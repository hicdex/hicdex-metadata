{"__version": 1, "token_id": 239622, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Get Out of Limbo", "description": "In The Divine Comedy, it is elaborated that due to these souls being otherwise innocent or righteous, the only punishment that they have to undergo is never being able to be in the presence of God. They are otherwise treated with honor and have their own version of a peaceful resting place: a magnificent palace of Wisdom and Virtue (inferior compared with Heaven). These souls forever hungered after the ultimate knowledge and meaning of life, but are doomed never to be satisfied. The children who died before they had a chance to be christened are also found here (though they are not demonized as they are in the game). By this reasoning, the sin of never having the chance to believe in God is considered the lightest of all sins in Dante's view and deserves the least of penalties. The souls who got the chance and accepted or believed that there is a God are spared this fate, and could go on to Purgatory and Heaven.\n1080 x 1350 px | mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeze8U4T1xDAAUyAYx42iMNzfYmfkb7dbaPiGDe7izcRW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXpbeo8rrpiRrrPZhXDBrVgsJ1PNfoZ6nL8SLLSmMFTa8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeze8U4T1xDAAUyAYx42iMNzfYmfkb7dbaPiGDe7izcRW", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Pg1LWQ6cDLJy7VRSvLV9RmBQQbDpvpzHU"], "tags": ["illustration", "animation", "motion", "myth", "mythology", "dante"], "extra": {}}
