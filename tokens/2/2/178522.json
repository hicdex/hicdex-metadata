The caps and stems emit a glowing green light in the dark. They glow brightest when they are about a day old and the surrounding temperature is about 81 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIt's been theorized that this type of fungus has evolved bioluminescence to attract insects to spread its spores throughout its environment. This super cool species is incredibly fascinating and is currently undergoing study to determine the biological cause for its bright green luminosity.
