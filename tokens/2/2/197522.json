These were so blinded by it that today the gifts are the gods.\n\nThe Materia Prima is the noble original substance in which the medieval alchemists allegedly were able to produce gold from untreated clay flakes. In a certain sense, this has not changed much in our modern consumer society.Today, we are able to create \"useless things\" from the noble original substances of the earth in order to produce shit (products) from gold again. These are now our modern gods, which will slowly replace the old monotheistic religions and send us back to the old times of polytheism. A time in which man still knew and worshipped many gods.
