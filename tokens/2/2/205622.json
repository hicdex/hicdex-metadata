She met Gus Wagner\u2014a tattoo artist who described himself as \"the most artistically marked up man in America\" while traveling with circuses and sideshows. She exchanged a romantic date with him for a lesson in tattooing, and several years later they were married. Together they had a daughter, Lotteva, who started tattooing at the age of nine and went on to become a tattoo artist herself. After leaving the circus, Maud and Gus Wagner traveled around the United States, working both as tattoo artists and \"tattooed attractions\" in vaudeville houses, county fairs and amusement arcades.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTYYG1fzr6mcjb3SLuE3AnYERCQj16Nw6PoCq4CwjKnxi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNsdt46yXmE7ivD7YmNxa61sNmPDFKPwmTEFf5i9yCsmx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTYYG1fzr6mcjb3SLuE3AnYERCQj16Nw6PoCq4CwjKnxi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
