{"__version": 1, "token_id": 181822, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "EGO DEATH (BLOOD TRIP SERIES #4 of 6)", "description": "You know that moment right after orgasm where you don't even remember your name? That is EGO DEATH, and psychedelics require it for them to do their work. You must be destroyed so that you may be reconstructed in a different form. EGO DEATH is a timeless experience. You might experience profound existential fear. Or you might have entirely forgotten what fear is at all. For some people, EGO DEATH is the goal and the point of taking psychedelics.\n\nFourth in a series of six. You can only receive this piece by collecting GOOD TRIP, the first in the series. You will also receive the other four images for free. Plus, one collector will be randomly selected to be gifted a 1/1 edition of the frozen blood macro photography shot that was the sole input for all the images in this series.\n\n2238x3968 JPG\n\nMinted July 24th, 2021.
