{"__version": 1, "token_id": 267222, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ace of Pentacles", "description": "To see the Ace of Pentacles indicates a seed being planted in the material world, in your feelings of security and stability. Like a seed, this opportunity must also be nurtured, and sometimes invested in with energy, time or funds. Watering this seed has the potential to be very rewarding - for anything that is grown on this energy is meant to be stable, secure and give a good yield. Prosperity is coming your way.\n\nOne also has to make sure that they are psychologically prepared for the opportunities that are appearing. To be able to harvest the gift of the pentacles, we need to be filled with the calm that stability brings - this is a kind of spiritual prosperity, if you will. This kind of mindset can mean we become open to trying new things and not sticking to the old, washed out routine.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreig6hajatmnjr7xphyqubiyan5yogznbp5ugak45ry6wcuhyoe4az4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreih3hqammuhouprazotsoinypqzobxmi5ia4msu47g54oderhzw7tq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreig6hajatmnjr7xphyqubiyan5yogznbp5ugak45ry6wcuhyoe4az4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1enACDiHTRGsVwS9XxrXuiz84ZABdTtdkm"], "tags": ["ai", "tarot"], "extra": {}}
