Each rectangle's height moves according to a phase determined by it's position on the grid. Pressing the mouse lets re-arrange the grid size and number of elements. Moving the mouse from left to right lets you explore several phase patterns and from up to down adjust the speed of animation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma519JMWB8aiA9CPh9LR7nT111dFtefzfe971R29UDeSr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSXJR4hDki7XfzPvakoxf5woT2yUPJKRtmogapCn6YR66", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSXJR4hDki7XfzPvakoxf5woT2yUPJKRtmogapCn6YR66", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma519JMWB8aiA9CPh9LR7nT111dFtefzfe971R29UDeSr", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1dc2ub1J3jTRQQYWN1BPmL6mUjMKGfadDE"], "tags": ["generative", "creativecoding", "p5.js", "p5js", "pattern", "interactive"], "extra": {}}
