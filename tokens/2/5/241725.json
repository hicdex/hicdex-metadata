After her death, there was speculation that she poisoned upwards of 30 sick people in hospitals to test out her poisons, but these rumors were never confirmed. Her alleged crimes were discovered after the death of her lover and co-conspirator, Captain Godin de Sainte-Croix who saved letters detailing dealings of poisonings between the two. After being arrested, she was tortured, forced to confess, and finally executed. Her trial and death spawned the onset of the Affair of the Poisons, a major scandal during the reign of Louis XIV accusing aristocrats of practicing witchcraft and poisoning people. Components of her life have been adapted into various different mediums including: short stories, poems, and songs to name a few.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZqMP2gL6r6pu4ADB5EZQzqcJzPbrZUuXm3swD4AeKxsb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX6uvSTB43VP1KGLuatPpfs9YEmuJ5yJM7tEdUqEAyiEt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZqMP2gL6r6pu4ADB5EZQzqcJzPbrZUuXm3swD4AeKxsb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Collage", "theartofmann", "189", "darkarts", "surreal", "french", "skull", "bird"], "extra": {}}
