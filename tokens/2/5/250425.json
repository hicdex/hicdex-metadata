But I tried to make a scene of it with VFX effect. One of the special aspects of this job for me was that for the first time, my work was watched and liked by more than 30 thousand people. Carotbeatcake contributed greatly to the sound design of this work. I can't describe the excitement when I first heard about this sound design.\n\nArtist: Deniz T\u00f6le\u011fen | Medium: Animation MP4:1280x1280 pixels | Duration:5 sec | Sound Design: Carrotbeatcake | Creation Date: MAY, 2020 \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZpnMT3f5CwTgdoR3vfrF3cyUUZ5H1Ecm5Tc5wZiNUbEk", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8DABif6RQH5Yca2PpSfsCMuVa9s6tKhT1nLapoL5Gu9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZpnMT3f5CwTgdoR3vfrF3cyUUZ5H1Ecm5Tc5wZiNUbEk", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gP87WfSA5a5SsBsFkeW4KoSNWL9pucN4c"], "tags": ["Avalance", "Vfx", "simulation", "animation", "motiondesign", "particles", "mountaindisplacement", "snow", "SoundDesign", "filmic", "cinematic", "shortfilm", "particles", "StanleyKubrick", ""], "extra": {}}
