He was only a kid when he immigrated to Tehran with his mother, after his father died/\n/He came back to live in the village once again, when he was around 60. He was always visiting Jarian during his life, but after getting older, he decided to settle in the only place he loves /\n-----\n35mm photography/ I often walk slow, I like to wait and watch people from behind.
