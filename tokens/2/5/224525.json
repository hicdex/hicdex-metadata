Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "[Pen on wood chip with some digital embellishments.] One of my fun hobbies is going up to the local playground, finding a few bark chips, and drawing monsters on them, then leaving the drawings for kids to find. I even get little kids who come up and watch me draw the monsters... (It's kind of weird, honestly, because I wouldn't let MY kids sit by some old guy that I didn't know... Apparently, I don't look like I'm going to eat the kids...) ---Richard F.
