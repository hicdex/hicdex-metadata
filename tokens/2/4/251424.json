Here I have reconstructed some of those fantasies.\n\nMUSIC:CUCUVOXELART\nSIZE:1500*1200", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd18AaAYypjA3ufZehWfJQRMWNcFCmLKJEaF2KJ5RVFkr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYN3wBxeeZN21jenc7raBJc8ZyEBE8VNcvSYaRNFznBdP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd18AaAYypjA3ufZehWfJQRMWNcFCmLKJEaF2KJ5RVFkr", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YEi9ZyTwtzE9utAn73rYCtBwFXoX34qEN"], "tags": ["VOXEL", "ARCHITECTURE", "noise", "colourful", "octaine", "green", "p5js", "psychedelic", "forest", "cleannft", "jungle", "cryptoart", "cleannfts", "tree", "nft", "fluid", "algorithmic", "circle", "creativecoding", "eyegasm", "abstract", "objkt", "animation", "glitchart", "motion", "object4objekt", "nftartist", "touchdesigner", "generative", "geometric", "sheed", "nfts", "python", "processing", "trippy", "hen200k", "particle", "interactive", "loop", "infection", "leaf", "colorful"], "extra": {}}
