Please Stand By, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, an homage to the late Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s famous spoken word poem. I think this poem is just as meaningful today as it was when he wrote it in 1971. Looking back at the race riots of the 1970\u2019s, it has sometimes looked like not much has changed in our country in the past 50 years. Racial inequity still bears down heavily on the black community, police openly shoot or assault unarmed black men in the streets often with no consequence, and boiling points have been reached for many across the country. But the revolution will not be televised, nor will it be twitterized. It won\u2019t come from something you see on TV or read on twitter, the change needs to take place in our minds and hearts, as Heron said \u201cyou have to change your mind before you change the way you live and the way you move.\u201d Hopefully the past year has moved our country and our minds in the right direction.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNeCpBZjUNMvy2U8Pvx6x2kJoSLPUE3pWfs5JgtLvdmVV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmajnMmLewGsnuzC7uonzH42ZrhFkVGJGUkyS7ffd6dxK1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNeCpBZjUNMvy2U8Pvx6x2kJoSLPUE3pWfs5JgtLvdmVV", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "digitalart", "digitalart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "colorpalettes", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "TV", "telvision"], "extra": {}}
