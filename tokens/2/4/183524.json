Thanks to a massive 10,000% cognitive boost, Tango was recognized as a fully self-aware being thus receiving Olodziar\u2019s citizenship and joining the thousands of dogs who are now part of the country\u2019s workforce.

After his day is over, he comes back to the MLNDR\u2019s place, where he cuddles with Greg every night and protects them from any possible harm by activating his deep-dream surveillance mode.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQgqohvPB24eKTe3TTwhgsyiiz9AAzBwYKa8dvFouRbgc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeU3BXMxL7wwsngtd8JVQTbnUsGzayFxD3MsKubVgBX6H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQgqohvPB24eKTe3TTwhgsyiiz9AAzBwYKa8dvFouRbgc", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QbnYfE8jJbVk6GjEKLHvJ94pDxVNvAWp1"], "tags": ["MLNDR", "Founders", "Collection", "NFTs", "Dystopia", "Dystopian", "Future", "Sci-fi", "Neon", "Cyborg", "Robot", "Colors", "Cyberpunk", "dog"], "extra": {}}
