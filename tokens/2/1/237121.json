Please Stand By, Big Banks Want To Take My Porn; Less than a week after banning porn from their platform due to pressure from Big Banking partners, OnlyFans reversed their stance on the position stating in a tweet it had \u201csecured [the] assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community,\u201d and \u201csuspended\u201d its policy change, which was slated to go into effect on October 1.\nWhile the reversal has come as a sigh of relief for the many sex workers making a living off of the website, many still fear their jobs are in jeopardy and that OnlyFans may RE-reverse their ban at the drop of a hat, especially given the language of the statement OnlyFans used. But what\u2019s most troubling about all of this is that the Banks have slated themselves as the \u201cmoral compass\u201d of society, and when an institution that wrecked havoc on the economy after years of lying, cheating, and stealing, crowns themselves the morality police of the world, it is a sign that we are living in a troubling time.
