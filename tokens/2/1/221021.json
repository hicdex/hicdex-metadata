The urban legend about this boar demon has been terrorizing Indonesians as we believe that a person can use a magic-infused black robes and turn into a wild boar. The boar demon, then, roams into targeted house(s) to scratch its body to things that are used to keep valuable stuff.  By the end of the journey, when it is back safe and sound, it\u2019ll transform back into a human and harvesting loads of money or jewelries in the black robes. \n\nIt\u2019s told that eight men were naked in order to be able to see and catch the wild boar. After beheaded publicly, its body parts were cut up and buried separately so they don\u2019t somehow magically fuse back together. \n\nThe Depok phenomenon turned into a court case as it\u2019s found that the whistleblower (one of the religious figures in the area) was also the one who bought the wild boar from an online marketplace for cat lovers for IDR 900,000 plus shipping fee. He testified that he did this to calm people around the neighborhood as many filed complaints about losing their money.\n\nPut your sound on to create whole experience to this piece.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma1ZJRDk6n4fzgBW3b9pYNRjTfXciymDteBXqpDQevsp7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXD9CgteNhUPTLwTNS3y9dYzZz8kmcYDfFvkVhaxVhCPx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma1ZJRDk6n4fzgBW3b9pYNRjTfXciymDteBXqpDQevsp7", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz2Be5VTGXvcCGUxkGHShDGqHW4V1VjjXvTE"], "tags": ["HENdonesia", "Indonesia", "CollageArt", "Collage", "Illustration", "Stopmotion", "MP4", "NFTCollectors", "NFTCommunity", "Drawing", "Digital", "Folklore", "Horror"], "extra": {}}
