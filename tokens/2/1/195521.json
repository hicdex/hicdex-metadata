I live a few blocks from three surfing spots. Longboarders prefer \u201cC\u201d Street as it has a long, soft right. Further up the beach about 300 yards is a point break with a little larger wave and a shorter but faster break. And then another 500 yards in the river mouth where it is more typical beach break except for the sandbar created by the river\u2019s flow.  The GIF is of one of the contestants in a surf contest.  In the video is a short, four line, rhyming  poem about the surfer.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYCF3uMQXS1v2GmrnGkx8nryPpBr7ber5r5AzBuifsMXy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYCF3uMQXS1v2GmrnGkx8nryPpBr7ber5r5AzBuifsMXy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYCF3uMQXS1v2GmrnGkx8nryPpBr7ber5r5AzBuifsMXy", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZeEcz8hStoqAKKC8BrC5hP6RqK8po3dwM"], "tags": ["Sports", "surfing", "surfer", "nature", "ocean", "beach", "sea", "waves", "outdoors", "athlete", "poetry", "poem"], "extra": {}}
