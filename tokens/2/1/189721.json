Please Stand By, Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start, the famous Konami Code. The code, released in 1986 for Gradius, first gained popularity in the NES classic CONTRA. Entering the code at the games title screen granted the player 30 free lives. The code was released mistakenly; created because the creator of Gradius was unable to beat his own game finding it too difficult, he devised a code that granted him extra lives, but forgot to remove the code before the final version of the game was released for the NES version. Since the code first appeared it has gone on to not only show up in Konmai games but has been co-opted across different publishers and various forms of entertainment even sometimes unlocking things on websites like Buzzfeed or Google. A lasting bit of video game legacy from one of the greatest video game companies of all time, and a code that has saved me from throwing and breaking many a controller. Colors inspired by the classic Konami logo.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZHaRbStRcpVvtRVHGDQ69PxumcaJhUyp3sy42P3MvqPP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehwpD73HqVQS1kryc9j9ZFeXQscBJtYSzMSg4C2S8c4R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZHaRbStRcpVvtRVHGDQ69PxumcaJhUyp3sy42P3MvqPP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "digitalart", "digitalart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "colorpalettes", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "TV", "telvision", "Konami"], "extra": {}}
