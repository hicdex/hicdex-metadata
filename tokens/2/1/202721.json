That's mine.  \n\nArtist name: Argus FS\nAddress: Bandung city\nPrint Size: 150 cm by 90 cm\nMedia: C-Print on canvas", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcSo9RXLZvBZmXeaBKiqtLhsK6nuK2FMUrgEsdFNKn9cz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeAi7Fwebv4nXd87i9HGZGDi7CAMikxcncb5RNk4GM1Gi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcSo9RXLZvBZmXeaBKiqtLhsK6nuK2FMUrgEsdFNKn9cz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NZ5ykiuwi2tVYoADZwq42d7waX1cBbJgw"], "tags": ["NFTart", "NFTartist", "ContemporaryArt", "PhotoCollage", "NFTcollectible", "Cheongsam"], "extra": {}}
