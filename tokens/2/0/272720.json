True randomness is never achieved, and true accuracy is never achieved, but there remains in the failed images a trace, or story, of the attempt.  \n\nThe Sisyphean Asymptote series is lightly interactive - click to glimpse a machine dream of the original drawing.\n\nCode for interactivity generously provided by Liam Egan - @neuromantic6", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdp1G3wApHuZiJYbJRPEGTtf4t3WZBpEsssnWNABJnrVp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVJp6w3L7ugJQurocuNLird5TfG3MACrXB79Nq4Z4iuE4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmTj55SW5Hk5oriypCDwDJvhcUzE5Da2ZaTu3jJcGw5sNY", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdp1G3wApHuZiJYbJRPEGTtf4t3WZBpEsssnWNABJnrVp", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["monoguys", "liamegan", "deleuze", "lines", "sisyphus", "light", "codeart", "genart", "organic", "failure", "systems", "drawing", "blender", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
