I have spent countless hours exploring and taking pictures here, yet it seems every time I go out to take photos, I come back with a lovely photograph. One of the things that sets this photograph apart from my other pieces is that I do not usually photograph traffic or intersections, I never really liked that. But on this particular night, I really liked the way the street, the scene, the people, and the rain came together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXFnZn9v7uwKPe4qU8p2LmRiVQzFSkF8bMArddf7Ytv8U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVs4J8ri2273vAn45X1x7ZuMXcr2pc9h8EgAgXPAfWKWC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXFnZn9v7uwKPe4qU8p2LmRiVQzFSkF8bMArddf7Ytv8U", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iimuCRajJPgHsMAtxUToEUiggn3uyMj4Y"], "tags": ["Seoul", "SouthKorea", "Scifi", "Neonnoir", "Sinseoldong", "Photography", "Art"], "extra": {}}
