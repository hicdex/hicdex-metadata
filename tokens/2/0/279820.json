After 2 major surgeries and lots of LOVE & PRAYERS, I'm back and stronger.\nBeing bed ridden meant I couldn't do things like move around alone and basic self-care tasks, additionally I had to become comfortable with asking for help and letting others help me.\nI was reminded Humans aren't meant to be alone or isolated, and that it's our connections and sharing that empower us the most. I wrote this for the people who accompanied me on this healing journey, I could not have done it without you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiftdlanlan6d5qa6seta3n2bibfpkxcr3ygj6rnzp2ti25typehdy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiedfe3r2xyzmexkbphq2v6kmicfzdxmyse4sheu74vrlmpffnuawi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiftdlanlan6d5qa6seta3n2bibfpkxcr3ygj6rnzp2ti25typehdy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dAKb5ntxNHCXxMhQTbvSGJW84y5S2Srwh"], "tags": ["gratitude", "manifest", "love", "blessings", "healing", "wellness", "rest", "selfcare", "purpose", "intentional", "sunrise", "sunset"], "extra": {}}
