The unlimited potential of outcomes in fractal Art is truly astounding.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihuqz6pohc3q5kg3t7yqr7gfmomgv7oxkp5jidewlhab5le4hcgzy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreie3ixnxal7kregm4vtz33vz4xhvn7awb2sczdqnxwmki3koflx2g4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihuqz6pohc3q5kg3t7yqr7gfmomgv7oxkp5jidewlhab5le4hcgzy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1acsjcCfbZYeWzkR53xG9otkFRrbHAfAQ9"], "tags": ["waves", "blue", "contained", "art", "fractalart", "fractal", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
