Heightmaps are generated by several GANs trained with custom datasets and then prepared and rendered into Unreal Engine as 3D terraformation.  While the concepts of map and border appear as mere theoretical and functional superstructure,  the landscapes and territories with their nuances, inlets, breaks, colors and topological diversity  depict the meeting of human data in the border points,  marking the landmarks of meeting and fusion of thoughts, feelings and experiences.  Latentscape will be presented as audio-visual live set as well as screen based installation.  Collectors of the 4 tiles will receive the original 16384x8640 300dpi master.\n\n| Franz Rosati 2021 | www.franzrosati.com | IG: franzrosati\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTydLX82tDE4mxFmuv7d5MRcD8D6R18WmQWTfzgn9WTtT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcptEvhdqL9Mg6F9FZfKp81dgPfPmT3oqVajRbyGGyerb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTydLX82tDE4mxFmuv7d5MRcD8D6R18WmQWTfzgn9WTtT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fiSnW1j287XbUwiQ9NATDRmGtiTwfGB4R"], "tags": ["landscape", "generative", "exploration", "gold", "chrome", "terraform", "cgi", "unreal", "light", "digitalart", "visualart", "3D", "print", "artwork", "gan"], "extra": {}}
