From where this panorama was taken, there are breathtaking views of more than 400 mountain peaks in Switzerland and neighbouring countries to enjoy. \n\nArosa is a town and a municipality in the Plessur Region in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden in Switzerland. It is both a summer and a winter tourist resort and has received major boosts in popularity in the past due to famous fans including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger; who was on holiday in Arosa during Christmas in 1925 when he made his breakthrough discovery of wave mechanics.  \n\nThis image is the result of five separate photos stitched together in photoshop.
