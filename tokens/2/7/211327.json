Beyond visuals/sounds, we have to consider the social context in which we are receiving the artistic expression.  ___ Is the style completely new?\nIs it carried over from a different medium?\nIs the style still developing in the new medium?\nHow differently is the style being expressed on the new medium? Does the new medium change the expression? ___ Very interesting questions with yet-to-be-known implications for society and culture, and the only way to know is to go through with the artwork. ___ In this piece I wanted to play with a style removed from design/typography. I want to see/feel what it\u2019s like to perform a \u201cmusic video\u201dNFT, AND to see what it\u2019s like to have it received by an audience in the context of where NFTs fit in art history/culture. ___ So here\u2019s to being vulnerable and free, expanding as an Artist, and experimenting with this rad NFT medium.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZXrSthShNG7DRJNK73EYKvWav8oRsQE5uDfRbZjSJmHN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPDksE6YAhwbCPLHFMnSHtivpxZQ58FCLKnPMXw23i6dG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZXrSthShNG7DRJNK73EYKvWav8oRsQE5uDfRbZjSJmHN", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1LBayeDsbbgDu7euVnKB8WywgNGkemvZiV"], "tags": ["capella", "vocal", "voice", "song", "singing", "music", "live", "performance", "meditation", "yoga", "zen", "video"], "extra": {}}
