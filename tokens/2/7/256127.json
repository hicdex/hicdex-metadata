With an interest in the external world, space signals, parallel universes, and ancient science and technology, he visits diverse research laboratories around the world and produces research-based artworks. EVOLUTION OF THE UNKNOWN #02, a new work commissioned by Mediacity Seoul 2016, is also a research-based project based on a visiting research and dialogues with scholars in the fields of astrophysics and aerospace engineering. For this particular work, the artist visited the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, the CEOU (Center for the Exploration of the Origin of the Universe) at Seoul National University, and had conversations with astronomer Myung Hyun Lee and astrophysicist Myungshin Im (professor of the department of Astrophysics, Seoul National University).
