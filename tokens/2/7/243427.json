He discovers hidden things and knows the future of wars and how soldiers should meet. He also attracts the favor of lords, knights and other important persons. He is depicted in the form of a goodly knight carrying a lance, an ensign and a sceptre (a serpent to Aleister Crowley). Alternatively, he is depicted as a ghostly spectre, sometimes riding a semi-skeletal (sometimes winged) horse, or the Steed of Abigor. This is a minion of Hell itself, and was a gift from Beelzebub. It was created from the remains of one of the horses of the Garden of Eden.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqXygNSsVdAk2qCwayMDrKUnttHYiqDQeUZybumhfqTB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ9GXNNfpKboiqvTkDptPDEEVkSkjY3yzS1bL71u9gA1U", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqXygNSsVdAk2qCwayMDrKUnttHYiqDQeUZybumhfqTB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WybfACSmvJfjz1NGHtshLvhLkNJtUfNzN"], "tags": ["3D", "devil", "demon", "dark", "666", "hell", "fire", "eligos", ""], "extra": {}}
