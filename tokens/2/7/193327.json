It shares its tendency to ooze or \"bleed\" with all mushrooms in the genus Lactarius. The indigo milk cap can be found in the coniferous and deciduous forests of eastern North America, East Asia, and Central America. The bluer the body, the fresher the specimen. And though it looks quite poisonous, it is reportedly edible and is sold in some markets.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWBxS6jiihJEtxFaTvCkVCqT1pNHF9F6r3SL25rnUBB4d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWBxS6jiihJEtxFaTvCkVCqT1pNHF9F6r3SL25rnUBB4d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWBxS6jiihJEtxFaTvCkVCqT1pNHF9F6r3SL25rnUBB4d", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
