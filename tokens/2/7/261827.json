It has a diverse appearance and belongs to the so-called \"endogenous psychoses\". As psychoses, clinical pictures are summarized, which are connected, among other things, with loss of reality, delusions, disorders of thinking, language and the world of emotions. The term \"endogenous\" means that the disease arises from a multitude of factors \"from within\", without recognizable physical causes and without any justifiable connection with experiences. Schizophrenic disorders are generally characterized by fundamental and characteristic disorders of thought and perception and by inadequate or shallow affects.\"\n\n2000x2600 .jpg\nHigh detailed Render\nArnold + Cinema 4D\n\nCharacter: Female\nName: -\nAge: 23\nHeight: 1.55 m \nWeight: 53 Kg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifxprm77dksfe5xlguwbjzrbn3eunc25aa2pwdqyygp4bx6ztk6qy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibjvvhygjfdtnqqdfjlzadesettqqyzx6qbu4duwincsj6gfmzmy4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifxprm77dksfe5xlguwbjzrbn3eunc25aa2pwdqyygp4bx6ztk6qy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eFKfuhFMWDHvFtGLeJMHexZ9DTBFupqa1"], "tags": ["Cinema4D", "Arnold", "Arnoldrender", "3D", "3DArt", "Art", "Character", "Female", "Sad", "Crying", "Schizophrenia", "Colorful", "Vestige"], "extra": {}}
