The process for creating this image included using a text prompt (not the title), algorithms, and artificial intelligence. The Snowpixel App was used in this process of creating this image. It may be interpreted differently through the eyes and imagination of the viewer.\n\nThe inspiration and words behind this image were to promote awareness about Africa's wildlife, wild lands and its endangered species including the Imperial zebra (Gr\u00e9vy's zebra) and the Mountain gorillas. The Imperial zebra is the most threatened of the three species of zebras (plains, mountain, Gr\u00e9vy's). It as well as the Mountain gorillas are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world's largest and oldest global environmental organization. \n\nYou are encouraged to support the wildlife and environmental conservation advocates, nonprofits, and other grassroots organizations that are working to protect and preserve Africa's wildlife, wild lands and its endangered species as well as promoting awareness about their status, safety, and needs.
