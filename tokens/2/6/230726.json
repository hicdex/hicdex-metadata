They have exceptionally fine flavor though. One of the absolute best. Although it is not that hard to identify you must be exceptionally observant of all characteristics. You cannot afford a mistake. There are some Lepiota relatives that are very poisonous or even deadly. You also cannot make the mistake of collecting an amanita!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYoKjQBV6bbD9gyYV2vQYFZehdoZPFJNGmZDbgnxEG7Cu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYoKjQBV6bbD9gyYV2vQYFZehdoZPFJNGmZDbgnxEG7Cu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYoKjQBV6bbD9gyYV2vQYFZehdoZPFJNGmZDbgnxEG7Cu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushrooms", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
