Each player uses Menko cards made of cardboard, printed with images from\u00a0anime, and other works. A player's card is placed on the floor and the other player throws down his card, trying to flip the other player's card with a gust of wind. If he succeeds, he takes both cards. The player who takes all the cards, or the one with the most cards at the game's end, \nwins the game.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiderbejijq3g2psaoqjommvlk2om65g3z5j4msq24bymvpnenjqhi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiderbejijq3g2psaoqjommvlk2om65g3z5j4msq24bymvpnenjqhi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiderbejijq3g2psaoqjommvlk2om65g3z5j4msq24bymvpnenjqhi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UuEEnvrpCkvzG9FprtDjgKpSYxXNEgLGm"], "tags": ["crypto", "cards", "collectible", "collectibles", "pogs", "Menko", "samurai", "ninja", "anime", "manga", ""], "extra": {}}
