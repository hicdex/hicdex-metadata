She ran away from home early in her life and among many other things became an opera singer in far away lands. In 1924, at the age of 55, she was the first European woman to cross the Trans-Himalayas in the dead of winter to reach the forbidden city of Lhasa in Tibet. During her life, which spanned almost 101 years, she wrote more than 30 books on eastern religions and remains today the most authoritative source on Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvc9sBr5TCkXwgAY8c6U8e17DiCMyKj1nFd9HkwYF4t5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTTxL9DWBvxF2bmJxv4dczAU331vQEoFYNTcwjPm747k6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvc9sBr5TCkXwgAY8c6U8e17DiCMyKj1nFd9HkwYF4t5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Spiritual", "buddhism", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
