You might encounter entities that want to help you through your psychedelic experience. Terence McKenna called them self-transforming machine elves. Psilocybin users speak of the mushroom gods. Whether you see them or not (depending on what you took and how much), by hook or by crook, you will be put back together. Just as your trip required an EGO DEATH, it also requires an ego reconstruction. You are re-assembled, hopefully for the better.\n\nFifth in a series of six. You can only receive this piece by collecting GOOD TRIP, the first in the series. You will also receive the other four images for free. Plus, one collector will be randomly selected to be gifted a 1/1 edition of the frozen blood macro photography shot that was the sole input for all the images in this series.\n\n2238x3968 JPG\n\nMinted July 24th, 2021.
