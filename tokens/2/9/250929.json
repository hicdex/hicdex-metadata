I have spent countless hours exploring and taking pictures here, yet it seems every time I go out to take photos, I come back with a lovely photograph. One of the things that sets this photograph apart from my other pieces is that I do not usually photograph traffic or intersections, I never really liked that. But on this particular night, I really liked the way the street, the scene, the people, and the rain came together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcaWF4FKTWcb62kntRXyMy1fFMs5F2jfYzejMGw2m2sz8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZZLNJYBAbKPwPEkagVtemsAMToYEBGr4YhDaz4CRrpoU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcaWF4FKTWcb62kntRXyMy1fFMs5F2jfYzejMGw2m2sz8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iimuCRajJPgHsMAtxUToEUiggn3uyMj4Y"], "tags": ["Seoul", "SouthKorea", "Scifi", "Neonnoir", "Asia", "Rain", "Night"], "extra": {}}
