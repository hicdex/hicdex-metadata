No longer in a time of open war, the gates are never locked and the village is often full of strangers on the road to Cadwell from Minute’s Harbour.   This tangle of hoary trees and dappled clearnings is home as much to covert merchant meetings as it is to children playing and the many tiny birds that live there.","tags":["castle","map","cartography","embroidery","linen","silk","bamboo","stories","fantasy",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmW6ZNP98QqdQXM9Lz3q1e4FyBtsu8h1JfQtsy2bYeZCq9"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmW6ZNP98QqdQXM9Lz3q1e4FyBtsu8h1JfQtsy2bYeZCq9","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}
