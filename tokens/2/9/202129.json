When she was born, I was six and her father, my older uncle was back from Japan only for two years. He immigrated to Japan before I was born, to make money and learn technical skills/\n/Niloofar is a wanderer like me, I see her as a mirror for myself. We often explore the village together. If we walk the same path for 1000 times, we still have things to discover/\n-----\n\n35mm photography from OYS series/\nI often walk slow, I like to wait and watch people from behind. A photo from someone\u2019s back is a proof of his/her existence in that time and place. It says nothing more, it shows very few details about that person. Only that they are humans. In OYS, I explore stories of people you don\u2019t see their faces in between notes\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc29wXBUxQXkwGKSNiKpeEtz84yiZh4Udj4FP7uUyVkBQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmadKG3nwzo5MNdAwcGXRdyCcHbaFh1tb1x6k8BFbp8AGQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc29wXBUxQXkwGKSNiKpeEtz84yiZh4Udj4FP7uUyVkBQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Photography", "Filmphotography", "Photo", "35mm", "Analog", "Human", "People", "OYS", "Photonotes"], "extra": {}}
