Gifting the collector the new, higher rez version. To create this image, I reversed the high resolution digital photo of my acrylic painting \"Rain\". Then I ran that through an AI filter. It has a completely different spirit, of playfulness and joy, which I really love. The original painting was of downtown LA at night, dark, surreal, about a sad period in my life. Rain represented my tears. Wonderful to have joy emerge from sadness.
