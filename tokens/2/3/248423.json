{"__version": 1, "token_id": 248423, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Objkt radar 5/7", "description": "This simulation of an analogue CRT screen radar has one main feature: it identifies itself by the current objkt number and hence ensures and presents its uniqueness in the vast sea of NFTs.\n\nThe algorithm aims to mimic the display process of the radar monitor. A scan line fires the pixels on the screen in a circular manner. If the pixel lies within an object, it lights up and glows out slowly until it is hit again by the scan line.\n\nThe user can control the speed of the scan line using the keys \"+\" and \"-\". The higher the speed, the more completely the object becomes visible, but the lower will be the scanning resolution. \n\nThis objkt will be minted in an edition of 1, but the same piece will be minted 7 times. As a result, there will be 7 unique outcomes, with each objkt showing its individual number on the radar screen.\n\nNote: Please give the objkt some time to load.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbeGBCZpZuC2bDeLfwYuJf3Y3Njk79oxEkd2v8QgeEJsy", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmezy477Z5N761zctQD87ywex1PgnYNrap4Un7F9ubjU22", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmezy477Z5N761zctQD87ywex1PgnYNrap4Un7F9ubjU22", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbeGBCZpZuC2bDeLfwYuJf3Y3Njk79oxEkd2v8QgeEJsy", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hmANNBuZ1RbUpcAcpKv5nmDEDrZhzzFUJ"], "tags": ["radar", "interactive", "analogue", "CRT", "screen", "pixelart", "pixels", "p5js", "retro", "generative", "self-aware"], "extra": {}}
