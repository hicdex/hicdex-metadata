Our body is not in space like things; it inhabits or haunts space. Colors of different modalities of our co-existence with the world. Spatial forms or distances are not so much relations between points in objective space as they are relations between these points and a central perspective-our body. These relations are different ways for external stimuli to test, to solicit, and to vary our grasp on the world, our horizontal and vertical anchorage in a place in a here-and-now.
