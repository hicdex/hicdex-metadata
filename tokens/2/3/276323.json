{"__version": 1, "token_id": 276323, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Plus", "description": "The plus sign, +, is a binary operator that indicates addition, as in 2 + 3 = 5. It can also serve as a unary operator that leaves its operand unchanged (+x means the same as x). This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number, especially in contrast with the negative numbers (+5 versus \u22125).\n\nIn his 1489 treatise, Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols \u2212 and + as minus and mer (Modern German mehr; \"more\"): \"was \u2212 ist, das ist minus, und das + ist das mer\".They weren't used for addition and subtraction in the treatise, but were used to indicate surplus and deficit; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiegek3rcwkcq732tmhq2xjporppclmj2rb4qzlpldyzzvc4ddex2q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreig4cwdqdsy32fxltfiw7r3bfsq3ten5tlnt5mbw3j5l27ump6e4oe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreiegek3rcwkcq732tmhq2xjporppclmj2rb4qzlpldyzzvc4ddex2q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SFTiZRgGN9domin29qNxJG72ik71k2YpU"], "tags": ["plus", "art", "record", "hen", "nftart", "collection", "1", "limited", "nft", ""], "extra": {}}
