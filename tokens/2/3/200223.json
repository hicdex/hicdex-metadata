From the generative program \"Hidden words\": A text resides in the computer and is displayed on a screen. However, it remains indecipherable, because the software continuously invents new logographic symbols, from B\u00e9ziers curves in three dimensions, to represent each word. It generates them, permutes them, and thus continuously creates a new writing system, a new code of representation of thought.\u00a0\"Silent words\" is part of a research that explores the relationship between gesture and sign, as other works explore the relationship between music and language. I will quote as a reference Brion Gysin, whose pictorial research tended to rid writing of the signifier and semantics in order to invent an imagined and silent thought.\u00a0\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/218768330\nhttps://www.ericvernhes.com/project/mots_silencieux/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPPjxwuM1yV7LNxZscZeAHYLipyddYYDkT5Fcwum71ssZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPHEp7YC1RKdJut8opnKDmyWD8UB2YJDuHwfa7eYWHoY7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPPjxwuM1yV7LNxZscZeAHYLipyddYYDkT5Fcwum71ssZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1M4eyRQagA3oQ2s9RPQGiTFP6SqLrRB6Aq"], "tags": ["generativeart", "writing", ""], "extra": {}}
