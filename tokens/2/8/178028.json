The logo developed into a peacock. Beneath it, a video presentation commenced\u2026 \u201c. \n\nThe printed version (2018) attempted to create animated paper by using the phone, QR code, & web as the link between the \"real\" and the \"virtual\", extending the experience of the 2D poster to a web-based virtual 3D reinterpretation.\n \nThe NFT version is an experiment in minting across blockchains & platforms. The image with QR code is minted on Foundation (foundation.app/@violetforest). When scanned, the QR code opens an IPFS link of the interactive NFT minted on Hicetnunc.xyz in an edition of 5. The work would depend on the responsibility of various platforms & owners to pin the content in order to keep the work alive in its entirety, raising questions of long-term content persistence and collaborative ownership / responsibility of IPFS pinning.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVteGetKMDLTf5uS5SiLwuxoUXyPmCmgJQGTC8TZTKDyh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXQ1zinfFfxVMi3JC4bjLPseauVt9jRkrKiUPM85e4uuT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXQ1zinfFfxVMi3JC4bjLPseauVt9jRkrKiUPM85e4uuT", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVteGetKMDLTf5uS5SiLwuxoUXyPmCmgJQGTC8TZTKDyh", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1YMqQQme7jcERyk2586QDT9fqWGCz9L2fQ"], "tags": ["experimental", "conceptual", "3d", "abstract", "aframe", "threejs"], "extra": {}}
