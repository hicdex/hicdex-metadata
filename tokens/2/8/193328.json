A quirky trait they all share is that they do not grow an open cap with spore-bearing gills; instead, the spores are grown internally and the mushroom develops an aperture or splits open to release the spores. Besides their general appearance\u2014similar to a plain old white button mushroom, but often much larger and sometimes covered in hairlike spines\u2014they're called puffballs because clouds of spores \"puff\" out when they burst open or are hit with, say, falling raindrops.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmabijFq5oUWnMR7yCkWvryhoKNmdq4T5t5ecYPdJT1spY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmabijFq5oUWnMR7yCkWvryhoKNmdq4T5t5ecYPdJT1spY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmabijFq5oUWnMR7yCkWvryhoKNmdq4T5t5ecYPdJT1spY", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
