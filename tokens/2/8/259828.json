The child cried but the caring dad could not get the bear out of the water. They left the bear behind. \n\nThe bear shivered with cold, from the water and from the distance from the love they deserve. \n\nThe cruel water tore at and deformed the bear\u2019s face. The spirit of Cthulhu found the bear and saw a mind it could easily conquer. The bears face grew long Cthulhu tentacles.\n\nThe reservoir was drained and rubbish collectors found the deranged bear and treated them as trash. Trash receives no love and the bear sensed cruelty. \n\nThe bear was placed by a trashcan on a public walkway. The public walked past but offered no love. The bear understood cruelty for the first time. \n\nCthulhu showed the bear how to invade the human\u2019s electronic devices.\n\nThe bear entered the images and photographs belonging to the humans. The bear would seek out what they deserve. The bear is seeking and they will find you.\n\nCthulhu the Bear wants love", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihp76il3o7clvibuegxaygquo6zlwmmd7igr2y4un45jc7mjy2nwi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreieidsa2gygjznigohzamcz5vbouln3eg2yw42zvn6ja2zbot2afzq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihp76il3o7clvibuegxaygquo6zlwmmd7igr2y4un45jc7mjy2nwi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iejkdRYyq7WdVtrXgpq1dtazsGpthkF1U"], "tags": ["cthulhuthebear", "bearism", "self-portrait"], "extra": {}}
