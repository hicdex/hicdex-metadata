It's 2,653m above sea level and while it's not the highest I've been. It's freaking high. On a clear day you can see as far as Chur and to the south across the Graub\u00fcnden Alps to Piz Bernina. On this day however, I was within the clouds.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfLqiomHemLHJqpMbVZmeHySjk9mkVXbw7DgTSm8k7AUW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTj1L6EtUKo1mZNMbN73bNyGroEEvRjQ9s7ZJiZfyLBuX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfLqiomHemLHJqpMbVZmeHySjk9mkVXbw7DgTSm8k7AUW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Xd3x8mbRMpmLeRGMfuRAHNYgWDim53BQh"], "tags": ["mountains", "grey", "clouds", "switzerland", "nature", "photo", "photograph", "photograph", "2d"], "extra": {}}
