When this OBJKT is burned, a unique 1/1 OBJKT (6471 x 10000 png) is generated using the wallet address and hash of the burn operation as a seed for the generation process. Once the new OBJKT has been generated, it is minted and transferred to the wallet who initiated the burn operation. The royalties on the generated OBJKT will be the same as this OBJKT. An 11x17 inch PHYSICAL version of the artwork will also be drawn (via the axidraw) using archival quality paper and ink. This will be sent to the buyer (international shipping costs are covered).The image above is an example using a random seed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeid5xasoxs7k3k3cm5eu3cadzjmmualldjx2hi5qihxnxpmci7svfi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeih4x7rr2xvpdzm5664l2qg5qjfwefo2lbi7tb645tvtepyb5rx7xu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeid5xasoxs7k3k3cm5eu3cadzjmmualldjx2hi5qihxnxpmci7svfi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RkYY3jr1ocuPdQqrRefr5FqoawKQsmBmD"], "tags": ["DIGITAL", "PHYSICAL", "ABSTRACT", "MINIMALIST", "GENERATIVE"], "extra": {}}
