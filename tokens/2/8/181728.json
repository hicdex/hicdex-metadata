Personal use only. \n\n\"Resistance\" reflects my personal struggles with the scarcity of time and journey of becoming an independent artist. This DREAM SERIES artwork will most likely be the last nft in the series in still image format, the future ones will be exploring further in video, interactive and 3d etc. Physical prints will become available later.\n\nDREAM SERIES is upcoming artbook from Walt Reunamo that explores ethereal landscapes and spaces of dreams, illustrated with vibrant figurative paintings.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQxxAuDpg7hWhs1Hr6k1EkEtxasB2sNQcNj1eWncYK559", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbbKYXBiQA1wNCZyvQdq6FJXfuyL7mEmKUYv9mMZGNhyL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQxxAuDpg7hWhs1Hr6k1EkEtxasB2sNQcNj1eWncYK559", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2VjNhD1wbTqYVg8rqypeGEfwACVVF15M5n"], "tags": ["waltreunamo", "fineart", "dreamseries", "color", "digitalpainting"], "extra": {}}
