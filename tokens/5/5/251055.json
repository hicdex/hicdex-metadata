Named Migaloo by the indigenous community in Queensland, at the time the whale was the only documented all-white humpback whale in the world.\n\nFor me Migaloo is symbolic of the vulnerability of whale populations. This series of paintings, focused on Migaloo, tells the story of his journey up and down the coast.\n\nSince 2013 Migaloo, whales and other crustacea have become a symbol in my work for all living creatures and the fragility of the environment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcXmm4XnahUN7BA1Vxfbno6gP3Ed8Mf16bxGJiJvaMecU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWck86fRfwCvcxgHNyv8wf9mPXr3M3yX36o5xAEZqoU2d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcXmm4XnahUN7BA1Vxfbno6gP3Ed8Mf16bxGJiJvaMecU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["WhiteWhale", "Whales", "Humpback", "StephanieFuller", "OilPainting"], "extra": {}}
