The swimmer navigates the atomic complexity of its surroundings \u2013 of which it is made up and in which it is reflected \u2013 in an endeavour tempered by an appreciation of its world.\n\n1890x450\n\n@microwave_cooks", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRRGJLggy7XpWwQ88pUAurALRmPXhY2ZAetiKuDXvfEQM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVMW4H2GXtQG8e5JaFSKBFUpQTr6mQkDPV2Ddb5sUY9uV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRRGJLggy7XpWwQ88pUAurALRmPXhY2ZAetiKuDXvfEQM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Td8xyvPN6FoE18RUoEFbVyJugkrbYgky6"], "tags": ["depths", "world", "swimmer", "diver", "microwave"], "extra": {}}
