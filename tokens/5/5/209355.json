There's so much that I can proud of off Indonesia: the nature, the people, the food, and the list can go on an on. We were all hit by a global pandemic, but the reality is grim in Indonesia, at least 118,833 deaths so far because of Covid. This year on 17 August 2021 will be our 76th year of Independence Day.
