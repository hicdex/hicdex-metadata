This cake is made of layers of poured jelly and blancmange. With each layer as half transparent, half opaque, an effect is created of an inner \u201cstaircase\u201d going into the core. This flavorway was created for my youngest child and their journey: white, milk, and dark chocolate. Have it for your journey as well.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT1TULJgC9PSQe4CXxCJjHBMgygsMFHZ6MxtGYqUwStkT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT5xM3289HaRW8yaDLAgeaUQs3aoWTegTTWeXxF3WMUX5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT1TULJgC9PSQe4CXxCJjHBMgygsMFHZ6MxtGYqUwStkT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iEBj6JB2iKDUCg2DPcyxbB3p9caVPr7Sd"], "tags": ["cake", "kawaii", "3D", "chocolate", "chocolatechips", "jelly"], "extra": {}}
