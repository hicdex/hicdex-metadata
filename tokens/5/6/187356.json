This is Tasting Note No1 by your favourite H=N Sommelier Richie: Louis Roederer Champagne Cristal Vinoth\u00e9que Brut 1996 - What a beauty that Champaign is. Absolutely astonishing. This wonderful color, this nose and that firework on the palate. Dear lord that\u2019s the kind of champagne I wanna have served at the heavens door. That laser-beam like acidity, cooked apples, brioche, yuzu, cream, biscuit are dancing  all together on my palate. That dance lasts unbelievable long. A true pleasure to drink.
