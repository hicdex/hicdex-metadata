The painting was exhibited in Sydney where it sold a number of years ago. \n\nFor me Migaloo is symbolic of the vulnerability of the humpback population. Whaling in the southern ocean is happening again. The series of paintings tells the story of Migaloo's journey up and down the coast and highlights the possible threats to his well-being.\n\nFor me Migaloo has become a symbol for all living creatures and the fragility of the environment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYZxZh6ywz1wrV8XqGaBBJH9vCvZ4c3QgP4o2xeTazVM6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqQfteZ3ZoiXvS1i3iXnPfKgiRKZJ9UAWJfJvcFgjgED", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYZxZh6ywz1wrV8XqGaBBJH9vCvZ4c3QgP4o2xeTazVM6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["whale", "whales", "orca", "humpback", "Migaloo", "StephanieFuller", "whitewhale"], "extra": {}}
