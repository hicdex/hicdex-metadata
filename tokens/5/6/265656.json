It\u2019s so strange what people dump. The way they leave it, the things they leave. Were they in a rush? \n\nI was going to post a life sketch of a set of drawers, and two seperate people said I should mint the rubbish I see instead, so I thought it fitting to include the photo and post that started it all. \n\nFascinating that I\u2019d post it on Instagram \u2018for free\u2019 7 years ago. Free at the cost of my data, where now I have spent $20 to post a view of my world, and that those people who liked \u2018for free\u2019 at the cost of their data, would have to pay tez to engage instead. \n\nWhen I took this photo I thought that Facebook likes would eventually replace money. Now after seeing NFTs emerge I\u2019m wondering if money will replace likes. \n\nAnd by money I guess I mean tokens of labour, value, attention, abstracted and transacted on networks with nothing to gain, nothing to lose, and no way to change without a confluence of the above.\n\nNetworks that let me immortalise abandoned food, so anyone looking back can see us as we really were. Strange, busy, momentary creatures, with unfathomable motivations and desires.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihf3rraczh4d36bpuh6ufrst4jtzzulk7qsxxx3g4cyl6uok3e7ry", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiehjryjnohxcexvio5s2thenaurqjdpjtkzojobsu66uq2cln5gn4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihf3rraczh4d36bpuh6ufrst4jtzzulk7qsxxx3g4cyl6uok3e7ry", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WcfbCgmvtt1ViHZep84jZD7b9f7gSxiP9"], "tags": ["Abandoned", "wastingfood", "photojournal", "genesisblock"], "extra": {}}
