As a single day was not enough for everything I wanted to do, I smoked a joint before going to the session as an attempt to order my thoughts and appease the desire to lie on the grass to do nothing more than receive the rays of the sun on my face, at that time my head was full of contradictions and I was struggling to order the entropy of the universe. Almost by inertia I arrived at the appointment, without knowing how or why, I just did it.\n\nI don't believe on coincidences because for me leaving things to \"luck\" is basically play cards with the universe, what do you have for me today Chronos? well I have this! As a jazz musician improvising, he have previous structures on which he moves and from time to time, allows himself to be imbued by the spirit of Ra and will open a portal to the present, everyone feel it, but nobody can explain it.\n\nThis is the portrait of a star before became on a sun, a galaxy, the big bang! the moment when something magical is going to happen. A representation of what I was at that time and what I aspired to be, but also talks about you... dear Entropy.\n\nGal Groisman | Uruguay | 2019", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihv7i3pisivbhdk2zkpwg2mr34a2whs6n6rky3ju5toveojwmkhc4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiej3qdmwqsif4hn4jmhhonqkznhefwwbw3bvxhynyiyojfi3k2bhq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihv7i3pisivbhdk2zkpwg2mr34a2whs6n6rky3ju5toveojwmkhc4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1as4hWB7ErLkNxVAFAL43BGruX8nV9amYb"], "tags": ["Photography", "portrait", "woman", "picetnunc", "photo", "cryptoart"], "extra": {}}
