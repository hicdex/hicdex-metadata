The toll! They\u2019ve come to take the toll!\n\n\u2028\u2028But don\u2019t you worry, beauty child, don\u2019t you worry not at all! The part of you that once was taken as worms or salt will be reawakened. Land forsaken, kept in store: famine, hunger, crops of war. If you ever find your corpse explored, you won\u2019t be needing it anymore! \n\n\u2028\u2028So leave and let yourself be eaten, don\u2019t you be so fucking beaten! Sweet as honey is your gut, a birthday cake will be your heart. We\u2019ll make some instruments out of you and then we\u2019ll dance more than a few! \n\nIt is a time for celebration! Homecoming and reincarnation! Give your carne to your siblings and then you\u2019ll see how much joy this brings. Who knew that rot could be so tasty when you mixed it with your blood! \u2028\u2028\n\nFrom mud we stem and try forgetting, always worried about the getting: getting that, getting this, never stopping for a kiss! Now, don\u2019t you worry, beauty child, I\u2019ll take your lips and make them mine. Someone else grabs your nariz and as we slowly take your bits we will welcome you as one of us.
