{"__version": 1, "token_id": 281859, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Paradox", "description": "Once a couple of summer ago, when my job with only one day off a week don't left me time for almost anything, I used that day for take these photos. As a single day was not enough for everything I wanted to do, I smoked a joint before going to the session as an attempt to order my thoughts and appease the desire to lie on the grass to do nothing more than receive the rays of the sun on my face, at that time my head was full of contradictions and I was struggling to order the entropy of the universe. Almost by inertia I arrived at the appointment, without knowing how or why, I just did it.\n\nI don't believe in coincidences because leave things to \"luck\" is basically play cards with the universe. \n- What do you have for me today Chronos? \n- Well, I have this! \n\nSimilar to a jazz musician improvising, where he has previous structures on which he moves and from time to time, allows himself to be imbued by the spirit of Ra and will open a portal to the present; everyone feels it, no one can explain it. \n\nThis is the portrait of a paradox, the moment when something magical is going to happen. A representation of what I was at that time and what I aspired to be.\n\nGal Groisman | Montevideo | 2019", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihv7i3pisivbhdk2zkpwg2mr34a2whs6n6rky3ju5toveojwmkhc4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiej3qdmwqsif4hn4jmhhonqkznhefwwbw3bvxhynyiyojfi3k2bhq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihv7i3pisivbhdk2zkpwg2mr34a2whs6n6rky3ju5toveojwmkhc4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1as4hWB7ErLkNxVAFAL43BGruX8nV9amYb"], "tags": ["photography", "picetnunc", "portrait", "woman", "nftphotography", "photo", "latamnft", ""], "extra": {}}
