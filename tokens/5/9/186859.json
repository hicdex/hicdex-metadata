Digitally transformed (1300x820 pixels). Those who buy the NFT will be drawn to the real Screen, in frame. Inspiration: When the moon\u2019s reflection meets the water mirrors, it forms an incredible scene to be observed. It\u2019s a beauty we need to behold at least once in our life. What would our nights be like if we didn\u2019t have the moon? It brightens the darkest nights, makes the stars shine brighter and makes the sky more beautiful and romantic.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaSPsE5Unys2Zhv8PFSr2SYE2pkw31X1vhKrWim9xnAuc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWZF9T3rnESmvfW9Wp4kc5LS329HMAjzSSEscPKWUviNP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaSPsE5Unys2Zhv8PFSr2SYE2pkw31X1vhKrWim9xnAuc", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PwGodpLX7vASxGEM6KQuJNGg7WnG3R7oa"], "tags": ["themoon", "moon", "beniciogaudino", "oilpainting"], "extra": {}}
