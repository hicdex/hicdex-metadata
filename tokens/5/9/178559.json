Orca is a 2-dimensional music creation program that is able to output MIDI signals in very fascinating ways. In this performance, the code that is generated is being fed into Ableton Live, which is handling the sound generation portion of the performance. All of the sounds are generated on the fly, and to sequence the musical events, the performer must comment out/un-comment sections at a time, or cut them from the workspace entirely, thus adding to the creative constraints of the performance. This is an electronic downtempo song that will take the listener on a deep trip through a foreign land, however the soundscapes should sound as groovy as they would if created in more conventional means. First owner of the NFT gets the right to use the code from the performance as they see fit.
