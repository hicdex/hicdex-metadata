It\u2019s quite finicky and time consuming to make. \nThere\u2019s also a legend: Once upon a time, a young chef wanted to impress the Empress of the Russian Empire. Not knowing that any dish made with honey drove her mad, he baked a new kind of  cake, flavored with honey, between layers of thick sour cream. It stole her heart and Medovik was born.
