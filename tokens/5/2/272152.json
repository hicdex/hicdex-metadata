The unlimited potential of outcomes in fractal Art is truly astounding.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeie3ciiqdredlrqcnb372z3gezkvcngba2rbbvc32dnffy4zqicqgq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicgkjam3iljgdqo6vtzmzfsvbfvcu2ydj6zew4eat7kxvghtmudum", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeie3ciiqdredlrqcnb372z3gezkvcngba2rbbvc32dnffy4zqicqgq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1acsjcCfbZYeWzkR53xG9otkFRrbHAfAQ9"], "tags": ["waves", "blue", "contained", "art", "fractalart", "fractal", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
