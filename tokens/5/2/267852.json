{"__version": 1, "token_id": 267852, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Liquid Reflections #5", "description": "Liquid Reflections Series examine the possibilities of using liquid forms and symmetry to create abstract images. Each image is a fight between order and chaos, where order imposed by the symmetry clashes with the fluidity of colours that cannot be contained in their boundaries. It is a fight of contradicting forces that govern our lives. Series consists of 8 artworks, each work is 4000x4000 pixels.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigfpdqz7kii3746z35burmtfmhgezq26cdyaugp4aliy7dddbqe54", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibqhkc5et4diy5o7e4eg6utzw3ket45tbj65xbflfavrx7fu7dkvu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigfpdqz7kii3746z35burmtfmhgezq26cdyaugp4aliy7dddbqe54", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1dFVePa546aLxLEKWmW2Xf9UKwYcJnTn5J"], "tags": ["Abstract", "abstractart", "modernart", "single", "abstractComposition", "liquidreflections", "papermarbling"], "extra": {}}
