The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcrfzDG9hNPbqjyZybVtRJE2yG85VypuF1mM9a2A1ocvX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcrfzDG9hNPbqjyZybVtRJE2yG85VypuF1mM9a2A1ocvX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcrfzDG9hNPbqjyZybVtRJE2yG85VypuF1mM9a2A1ocvX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"], "tags": ["CCA", "GENERATIVE", "RANDOM", "114"], "extra": {}}
