Since 1500, the year of the European invasion, these rich peoples have been undergoing a process of diaspora for 521 years, which is reaching its peak today with the struggle against the time frame of indigenous lands. The Extraordinary Appeal with general repercussion (RE-RG) 1,017,365, which is being processed at the STF, is a request for repossession filed by the Environment Institute of Santa Catarina (IMA) against Funai and Xokleng indigenous people, involving a claimed area of \u200b\u200bthe TI Ibirama-Laklan\u00f5. The disputed territory was reduced throughout the 20th century and the indigenous people never stopped claiming it. The area has already been identified by Funai's anthropological studies and declared by the Ministry of Justice as part of its traditional land.
