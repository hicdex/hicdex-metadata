I still have my respect to the previous artists, but somehow their works have no emotional connection with myself. They are just history in art lessons. A marker of their time indeed. But do I want to have it? I do not think so. They belong to the museum.\n\nI like art that has a statement. Artwork that have the ability to provoke anyone who sees it. The one that make you feel something. Not just some pretty and fragile things for your fancy house.
