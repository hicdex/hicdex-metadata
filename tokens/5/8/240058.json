This process is repeated until the bounding box prevents any more lines being drawn.\n\nThis set is my first digital attempt, drawn in a moving vehicle for extra error.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZxqYXaoQgpty352Jk45dPMavSDYVgPGerSooqzkpMbUr", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmabq1mV1Z7AXp3LgtGuY91YqsRaos3Y5maTRaXSDYRaW2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZxqYXaoQgpty352Jk45dPMavSDYVgPGerSooqzkpMbUr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "digitaldrawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
