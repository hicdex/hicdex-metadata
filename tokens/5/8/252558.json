This process is repeated until the bounding box prevents any more lines being drawn.\n\nThese artworks form what was my first digital attempt, drawn in a moving vehicle for extra error.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVpgguZVrmT5AV57NNpr2dApAzzVRaAA7GZeaJ83vgmJd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX7jLaEDjLm7Nr3TDvDQnYM3gmfqnrduCJVfgHGaS4xxF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVpgguZVrmT5AV57NNpr2dApAzzVRaAA7GZeaJ83vgmJd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "digitaldrawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
