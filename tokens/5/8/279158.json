It was Initially developed during my doctoral studies at Goldsmiths College in London when I investigated the drawing practice and how to enable a robot to draw from observation. It has since been in constant development. Since 2011 it is controlling the behaviour of the robots used in the performative art installations I exhibit.  The initial work is the subject of several peer-reviewed research papers you can find via google scholar. In March 2021, at the beginning of hicetnunc, I wrote a  new layer with a graphical interface over the system to be able to have control over a system that was originally designed to be autonomous. The new system enables the production of digital artworks (stills and animations), using generative algorithms with feedback loops, computer vision, and machine learning models (AI). Thus the artworks are produced in a semi-autonomous manner. The way I work with the system is very similar to the way I was working when I was a painter (1990-2000).\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiho7yc6fwdwnuc7nlx3a3em7dbm6st4g4y5h7xne6ujwdlp4h6o4u", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiho7yc6fwdwnuc7nlx3a3em7dbm6st4g4y5h7xne6ujwdlp4h6o4u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiho7yc6fwdwnuc7nlx3a3em7dbm6st4g4y5h7xne6ujwdlp4h6o4u", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZSmQg3dnofX2PCNVAuZf4z8KbNW2cZGF9"], "tags": ["vanitas", "gif", "computational"], "extra": {}}
