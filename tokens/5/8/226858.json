I presented self-portraits made in 1995 and 2009. In 1995, my father committed suicide, shot him self, and the photographs relate both to his action and the father and person he was, and to my way of life. In 2009 I underwent surgery that greatly affected my medical condition, following which I was determined to be disabled and with a loss of ability to work. I have gained 60 kilos since then, and in the future I will probably deal with the gap between my appearance then and today.\n\nwork size - 40x30 cm.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfWBA82wLa4jruhPUUNqDT98yURDvXqaQtKUL963UgJ4g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcSagwnmqCJ8w4jjrhZGCEpQ2D7U4cyo3qCTFM3hXmaDe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfWBA82wLa4jruhPUUNqDT98yURDvXqaQtKUL963UgJ4g", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1S5PUhzQVvHyqbLPpAqKvstfGuWa3MKQXP"], "tags": ["digital", "portrait", "bride", "b&w", "photography", "selfportrait"], "extra": {}}
