I approached him on the corner of Caroline & Lamar St\nI asked him if I could take a photo and he just told me sure.\nNot sure what compelled me to ask him to write, but I did even though he was short with me, and he agreed.\nHis writing and explanation was a bit odd, so I cut the conversation off after listening for a bit. He was definitely one of the strangers that stood out the most to me just due to his page.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib4k43qg3gblr7nyylux46idhgk5stnm345tbbryvhimfefteivhe", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiatipl54aukl4j2ye4o27pbl6mqlmt7lpljy563svqumo4aybulzq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeib4k43qg3gblr7nyylux46idhgk5stnm345tbbryvhimfefteivhe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
