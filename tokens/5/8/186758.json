This OBJKT will lock itself 100 min after it has been minted. All editions collected during that time-window will stay unlocked. Locked OBJKTs can still be collected. When ALL editions are sold, ALL editions will be unlocked!\n\nWARNING: Do not send this OBKT to someones wallet directly. Every trade of it outside of hicetnunc will most probably break the edition (while sending it back would probably fix it again)\n\nThis OBJKT uses the hicdex API and therefore depends on it. This is all experimental. Be aware that this OBJKT may break in the future. - @TeNinEightNFTs", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSTC728D6pgD1KntYjjp1B6nh3yYLxAmVH3hwfdYVsWKh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWwrf6hBQDiiQm9FbkxFuGfvviLi7kcrATZKN3nA1DKvW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWwrf6hBQDiiQm9FbkxFuGfvviLi7kcrATZKN3nA1DKvW", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSTC728D6pgD1KntYjjp1B6nh3yYLxAmVH3hwfdYVsWKh", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WwLpnjMbjfQEmUpExC8wqNuZP5vTjYqgS"], "tags": ["noisefield", "noise", "p5js", "generative", "procedural", "realtime", "100x100hen", "100x100", "autolock", "triple", "trinity", "pulses", "interactive", "tenineight"], "extra": {}}
