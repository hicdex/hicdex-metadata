Like all wishes, they are thought, felt, projected, with such strength that they finally flap their wings and begin to fly, coming true. This leaves room for new wishes.\nEach edition will be one of our butterflies of wishes. A single butterfly that will represent our desire. Once our wish is fulfilled, it is time to let it fly to fulfill a new wish for someone else. These butterflies will fulfill wishes forever. Don't underestimate the power of butterflies.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmesRBxeG3aWrDvig5mStdFsjTcbqokYMJvRactGpaXzg9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmedETdNNWKXRMtPWAW2HTSNWEzme93tSwq4SpHpykHHT4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmesRBxeG3aWrDvig5mStdFsjTcbqokYMJvRactGpaXzg9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dRqDN8nm3rSXJ1eYvWcycfWJuSrLnYc9v"], "tags": ["butterflies", "wishes", "iguazufalls", "transfer", "esotericism", "slowmo", "objectives", "goals", "wish", "video", "slowmotion", "capture", "moments", "nature", "fulfill", "strength"], "extra": {}}
