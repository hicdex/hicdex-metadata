The fairies were somewhat peculiar, and came in a set of three. The sisters Faye, Ferne, and Fawn noticed one day their tree was gone. They moved to a new one not far away, and a set of three they decided to stay. This one is Ferne's home, set in the tree's hollow, a cozy place for her this year, and hopefully many to follow", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiftfubsqrn5h74laew7b5tztfiz4meoludd4v6wflky6n4cscivsy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreieq4rn3ukq3jo5wed4lyfqdqyiqsh6of5gmmqtmfzxtje2pzl3iyi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiftfubsqrn5h74laew7b5tztfiz4meoludd4v6wflky6n4cscivsy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SYRMfPA1vPivZhcdZygjufF3dxuaR1q81"], "tags": ["AI", "MachineLearning", "generatedart", "Fairies", "pink", "magic", "home", "cozy", "cupkait"], "extra": {}}
