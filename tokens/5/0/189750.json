At that time, he was treating Thomas, a patient who was rejected by Jung, because he only wanted to do therapy naked. Thomas smoked pounds of marijuana, and I loved it, but he was infinitely lazy to do anything. He could spend days on that couch smoking the joints I brought for Freud. Freud didn't know what else to do to make Thomas more outgoing. That's when I introduced cocaine to Freud. He loved it. Thomas too. You can see from the photo that he was very comfortable, having a lot of fun. He didn't get up from the couch, but we talked for over a week. It turned out that, in the end, Thomas beat Freud, and we all ended up naked, chatting on the couch.
