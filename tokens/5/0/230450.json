Premises in the methods and conception of cinema according to the French director.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQNtUV64rfYcuDmGqfziL5EwJdo8qkswJNpE2KmA37S8k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQNtUV64rfYcuDmGqfziL5EwJdo8qkswJNpE2KmA37S8k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQNtUV64rfYcuDmGqfziL5EwJdo8qkswJNpE2KmA37S8k", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MGcHh8zEwD4mDX2mWogrbu4tn9b5mCmPM"], "tags": ["cinema", "shortfilm", "experimental", "generativeart", ""], "extra": {}}
