Set in saturated tones, AI-generated figures formed from collective imagery set from user-sent pictures now present themselves new. What follows are pseudo memories that question us about their existence. Did these memories hold a name in the past? Are the users only letting go now due to the effects of time and eventual degradation? Nonetheless, as specimens now with new user names, they are captured again.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX2ygtPhnDE2Z2fvJeuB4xmX2CgRtJerKm4ST3hQuiRrR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX78GTFL8EWUNqarpNBrQxWKzLMXWfqbNdaP8s5X8kGV8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX2ygtPhnDE2Z2fvJeuB4xmX2CgRtJerKm4ST3hQuiRrR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XR6K5u8atyJGJjm6EawvnwGq7odbMKmzQ"], "tags": ["gan", "generativeart", "ganart", "generative", "past", "present", "future", "machinelearning", "neuralnetwork", "contemporaryart", "digitalart", "modernart", "surrealism", "surreal", "aiart", "jettroxx", "memory", "untitledmemories", "popart", "photomanipulation"], "extra": {}}
