He seeks to reflect on the causes and consequences of human actions, with emphasis on issues related to the anthropocene and its consequences. His procedural and methodological search is structured from the use of technologies, old and current, mapping, cataloging and restructuring traces of the trail left by human beings, based on the belief of domination over nature. From a systemic perspective, his work ranges from punctual elements to events with a global impact. The visual complexity generated by the profusion of layers, images and meaning, is directly related to the complexity of understanding the issues involved.
