The crystal skulls have been of great interest to archaeologists and anthropologists who are curious about their existence and purpose. Why would so much work and time be spent on perfecting a human skull made out of one of the hardest substances known to man after diamonds, rock crystal? The cutting of which requires great expertise and precision and the carving and polishing of which is equally time-consuming? In other words, why a skull?\nAre there other skulls?\nCan we discover the secret of the energy of these skulls in the future?\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiexljetigztzmcmarpsealnhj4mrcnq5jqfheq7xl7p62xl2bdtxm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibxwna43ieognnjyy4caq5pm36vphgn23nnkbjiavvu2blnzpjy6m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiexljetigztzmcmarpsealnhj4mrcnq5jqfheq7xl7p62xl2bdtxm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hgbktXwdHqXmUhdYNp3acphKbMuiLvc1W"], "tags": ["crystalskull", "ancient", "ancientaliens", "Skull", "colorful", "secret", "generative", "hen200k", "cleannfts", "fluid", "cryptoart", "jungle", "particle", "3dsmax", "trippy", "nft", "object4objekt", "arnold", "alavi", "alavicg", "glitchart", "processing", "nftartist", "animation", "infection", "abstract", "psychedelic", "creativecoding", "forest", "p5js", "colorful", "geometric", "interactive", "green", "touchdesigner", "algorithmic", "leaf", "loop", "colourful", "eyegasm", "objkt", "tree", "noise", "nfts", "motion", "energy"], "extra": {}}
