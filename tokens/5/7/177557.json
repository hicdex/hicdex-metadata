{"__version": 1, "token_id": 177557, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Heteroclit 2", "description": "Heteroclit 2 installation offers an examination of semiotics and the laws of perception from the perspective of the concept of neutrality, evoked by the oscillation between the various visual modules in which the value of truth or untruth of the paradigm is thwarted by a \"vibrating time\" (Barthes), whereby a simple term (square) manages not to submit to an absolute value. Vibrating time - an annulment of forces by equilibrium (oud-\u00e9t\u00e9ros-Greek-neither one, nor the other); term also found in Nagarjuna's tetralemma (c. 150 - c. 250 CE), motto 4 - \"a thing neither exists nor not exists\" or in Sanskrit - neti-neti (\"not this not that\"-Upanishade), urging an analytical meditation on the real self which is, in fact, a non-self (Anatman) which transcends all experiences and denies the mind to the point of purification from dual judgments, leaving nothing but the real self(non). Heteroclit becomes an instrumented metaphor with the ability to exemplify a constant, which makes it possible to receive an idea-symbol (irregular, unforeseen), intending to cancel and/or disrupt the dialectic, generating vibratory energy that facilitates the poetic signifying of alternation, as opposed to uniformity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW8gP9EFvHdMdmWzeWNPxo6jZaBUD5tY4x1bwcC7ac7kW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4dqXxz1cRZEHhMBrTKTXs7YFvEV6PiwsgbCCVxJbD98", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW8gP9EFvHdMdmWzeWNPxo6jZaBUD5tY4x1bwcC7ac7kW", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2XAMKLnjjtAt9aWGvd29Hn3X88iZWV6eyU"], "tags": ["installation", "semiotics", "digitalart", "art", "videoart", "conceptual", "semiotics", "conceptualart", "art", "concept", ""], "extra": {}}
