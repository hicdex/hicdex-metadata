If we adhere here to the interpretation of a mask as a symbol of social role one is supposed to perform, then in the artwork the social role turns into a ghost haunting the subject. According to hauntology, a ghost is that \u201cwhich is neither present, nor absent, neither dead nor alive\u201c, an old so-cial form, construct or a concept that haunts us in our presence and doesn\u2019t allow to move forward. We always remain at least partly tied to the past although we are aware that it\u2019s not fully relevant anymore. Referring this to the issue of gender roles and masculinity we could say that we live in a specific period of interregnum which, according to political thinker Antonio Gramsci \u201cconsists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born\u201d: the old social roles, old visions of what does it mean to be male or female are dying but the new ones are still not emerging (and maybe they even shouldn\u2019t?). The art of Nikolas M\u00fcller epitomizes emotions \u2013 feeling of loss, confusion and authentic suffering \u2013 that accompany this state. By means of sharing with us his intuitive emotional world he problematizes the traditional imagery related to masculinity in an attempt to find a way out.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYA3rNSupAUdb6jJaLPwS3QETjCcJDF81e6Dp3kgh7SHZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma9DarLNx43kiKNeF6AGgxGEpf86BVr9ZyaXCgSDJZhrD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYA3rNSupAUdb6jJaLPwS3QETjCcJDF81e6Dp3kgh7SHZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Xcco4ALWFUeeAkdykQhS1CGWx65vgANcw"], "tags": ["3D", "feminismus", "alpha", "male", "mask", "demon", "fear", "punk", "pink", "hair", ""], "extra": {}}
