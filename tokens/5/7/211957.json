Everything had been fine the day before, she had been texting back and forth with them on group chats and they had all seemed perfectly happy. Her phone pinged and she looked at the text that had popped up on her screen with tired eyes.\n\nDo what I say and nobody will get hurt. Come to the auditorium now.\n\n-Ace\n\nHer heart was pounding incessantly, she almost felt it reverberating through her bones as she practically sprinted to the auditorium. Nobody was there, it was pitch black and completely terrifying. She felt as if she had walked into her own personal horror movie. The screen in front of her suddenly lit up and a deep, robotic voice rang out over the speakers.\n\n\u201cMy name is Ace and you have betrayed me. You will pay.\u201d The speakers cut off and Sumire was left on her own trembling. Where were her friends? And what the hell did she have to do to get her them back? Suddenly, the door behind her opened and she spun- she hadn\u2019t realised she had been crying until just now.
