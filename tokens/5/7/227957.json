You'll meet him as only a shadow of what he represented for so long, completely dissatisfied and mourning for what was once his pride. Among all qualities lost, still remains that annoying calmness in his actions, yet to face the fact that it's a total state of agitation. Your feel a head rush, a rapid drop in your blood pressure as you stand up, the dizziness lasts a few seconds, the world is so silent you'd hear the sound of your eyes blinking. You open up your eyes and everything is back to normal. Except that this time all lines have met, even the parallel ones. |", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPcQVqdezuvP3jEEH4tUG6Nw6e5b7eHhdNjEkFPoZgXrf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbQYCuUPWwfmcXpFQqr2H8PP3SXW8kCc1ArACEQdyQsHU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPcQVqdezuvP3jEEH4tUG6Nw6e5b7eHhdNjEkFPoZgXrf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YEXFMCxuFSbJJw83gCbpXotgu8oR5oKJe"], "tags": ["Art", "Illustration", "Story", "Sketch", "Collage", "Photography", "MixedMedia", "DigitalArt", "ShortStory"], "extra": {}}
