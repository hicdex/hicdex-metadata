The result is a work that resembles the sea during a storm, which knows the Chaos as its only God!\n\nInspired by The Great Wave Off Kanagawa by Hokusai, the work is real time generative, and the algorithm involves Flowfields, Perlin noise, physics and flocking systems. It has been first presented on FRAMED* as a 3 minutes video loop and exhibited across the globe (Taiwan, Japan, Netherlands, United States), and is now presented as a NFT for the Processing birthday fundraising.\n-\n30 seconds 1280x720 30fps MP4/H264", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRYu4vFp8in1LKzzwnJsbVbBiiPENsgb6MXhzYKKGnF4p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTJnDwYxLWu47Xaa3zpYobYpu8vZ586J2CWgPLTvaxvpg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRYu4vFp8in1LKzzwnJsbVbBiiPENsgb6MXhzYKKGnF4p", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WGJvf3RE32KBbZPaiMFEAgaGszHss42s4"], "tags": ["generative", "art", "artwork", "creative", "coding", "sketch4processing", "processing", "animation"], "extra": {}}
