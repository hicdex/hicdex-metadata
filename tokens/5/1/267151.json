Resulting runtime: 1min 18sec. No audio. Unique labyrinth configuration (\"VX\"; no. 2) in a series of 5 different ones.\n\nAn algorithm-loaded point-like object decides randomly in each step on the direction of the next step, if there are such possibilities open. If it reaches a point of no further possibilities, it travels backwards along the youngest possible path segments until it reaches a point which still has open possibilities. While moving along forward, it draws a red path. In the final stadium, when the whole space is filled with paths, the white labyrinth walls are drawn into the free spaces separating the path segments and the path disappears.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiahixzqtsyw7mdddmyrf6a7us3jrdlcmywd5grbnhqa3uuvss6eau", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibkajpwajrrkbetmsq2qu4anxompn5ddvp23klq2jomvkeheohddm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiahixzqtsyw7mdddmyrf6a7us3jrdlcmywd5grbnhqa3uuvss6eau", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hmANNBuZ1RbUpcAcpKv5nmDEDrZhzzFUJ"], "tags": ["algorithmic", "retro", "visualization", "generative", "minimal", "random"], "extra": {}}
