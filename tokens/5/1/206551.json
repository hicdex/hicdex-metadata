In between two of the breaks are a couple section breaks known only locally as \u201cPipe\u201d (where a 3 ft. diameter pipe extends into the ocean) and Stables\u201d (where there are some stables.  Makes sense.) .  When a local says where they are going they say we\u2019re surfing \u201cPipe\u201d: not, \u201cThe Pipe.\u201d But \u201cPipe\u201d.  Same with \u201cStables\u201d    It\u2019s like saying we are going to surf \u201cTrestles\u201d  Not \u201cThe Trestles\u201d\n\n10.9 MB (11,483,420 bytes) GIF file\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNj73GPbmbtSWHTAXB5qJwyUTnZjds5yJHLThA4KYqNgX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNj73GPbmbtSWHTAXB5qJwyUTnZjds5yJHLThA4KYqNgX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNj73GPbmbtSWHTAXB5qJwyUTnZjds5yJHLThA4KYqNgX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZeEcz8hStoqAKKC8BrC5hP6RqK8po3dwM"], "tags": ["Sports", "surfing", "surf", "surfer", "nature", "outdoors", "beach", "ocean", "athlete", "athletes", "beach"], "extra": {}}
