Used about 7 in that clip, duplicated etc.\nMerged them together in simple video editor, created a sound loop on my DJ gear using 2 sound files, cows and chill out sample.\nCombined both files in PhotoMosh Pro, enabled few filters, some sound active, some not :)\nEnjoy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXDNBW3ErkuM6FfkqmWk5tCnLxfgZij5TDPYH41CbQ6XK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbhLfr9CB51zk6qBDrDqmizefajfu3xixWzCgc8oh9iEV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXDNBW3ErkuM6FfkqmWk5tCnLxfgZij5TDPYH41CbQ6XK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NnGL1vBYtpgwWg83PbpAdA9esS7tLKMiG"], "tags": ["motion", "photo", "filter", "animals", "audio", "jitter", "rgb", "strobe"], "extra": {}}
