The AI of the ship Daedalus, is one of a kind. It's code contains parts from ancient scriptures of earth, so it can dream, but only while travelling through hyperspace. To dream it needs there to be some trinity particles around.When there are no particles left in the surrounding, then it dreams its nightmare into those sleepers. People normally dream about past, not about future, or as their religious texts claim, about another type of life after this one. Some machines dream about past too but you wouldn't want to know about the nightmares of a machine like Daedalus. So they hear the new voice speaking in their dreams, but before they say anything,noise changes. Some kind of machine language is loud in their eardrums.They realize, it was modulated sound of dreams/nightmares coming from the Daedalus.|All images used in this work are licensed under CC0/public domain | @atimtay | linktr.ee/atimtakus   ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXveVDWFctrTv5ExLxWRnVm6z7jrknNayAz6xgtik2Jwt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbVQnwXvgBtceEZ4gnbaT61V2DN8Huaj3vjrQni1L2194", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQ2EoYtS9F9tswEUtJiJZGREyoyEZH9Uw2ozNFAGKgcUr", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXveVDWFctrTv5ExLxWRnVm6z7jrknNayAz6xgtik2Jwt", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1XvP1MfRgh6DbHhVXK5TTqKznV5MYCGoMv"], "tags": ["dystopia", "challengetnunc", "scifi", "gpt", "interactive", "retro", "atimtay"], "extra": {}}
