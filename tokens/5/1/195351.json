In order to understand how animals are transformed into the meat that we eat, during a one-month residency at English Harbour Art Centre in Newfoundland the artist Kim Waldron put herself in the shoes of the slaughterer, the butcher and the cook. She produced a series of photographs in the form of a documentary that questions the profound disconnection that we live with in relationship to food. This is the second of a suite of three GIFs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUVFsJWdDNNA2bUYiGpDpgyqmS6NKJPGJ1tJTchd8Lh6C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUVFsJWdDNNA2bUYiGpDpgyqmS6NKJPGJ1tJTchd8Lh6C", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUVFsJWdDNNA2bUYiGpDpgyqmS6NKJPGJ1tJTchd8Lh6C", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1eJs81pPyWiRV5eMXHUvwPmWfQeZxtZR5J"], "tags": ["kimwaldron", "meat", "photography", "animation", "gif"], "extra": {}}
