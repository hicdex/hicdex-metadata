When the sun shines, it not only brightens our day; it also enlightens us, our spirit, ridding it of the gloom that the night's darkness had brought with it.\n\nKolukkumalai is my favorite place to take sunrise pictures. Seeing the sunrise from Kolukkumalai is always an amazing experience. \nThis time when I saw it, I thought it was divine rays from the heavens, illuminating the world.\n\nLight may also be seen as a spiritual sign of hope. Light represents redemption from the darkness of sin in various faiths across the world. Believers get confidence from the knowledge that shining their light of faith in a dark world may bring about positive change in their life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP5yiQghP8xcUitakFdBadVn8qf7MsXnekng7ND9D54gX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSKqhxN3YUq9h4qhZZy4YtRf6NJjBidR6LjXWVfRHNrya", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP5yiQghP8xcUitakFdBadVn8qf7MsXnekng7ND9D54gX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1erbdBpdGjbZ34m7kbVSa3i1ELYNzKWfPQ"], "tags": ["sunrise", "light", "soul", "heaven", "faith", "sunshine", "life", "humanity", "mankind", "Kerala", "India"], "extra": {}}
