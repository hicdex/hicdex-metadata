There are over a hundred such spirits, each worshiped for its unique powers. The worship is an elaborate night-long event held at permanent shrines or at temporary sheds. With rapid urbanization taking over, such rituals are gradually fading away from public sight and memory.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUPBam6SfAXuJhXkAnKCuVMY1Hu9qgA3vTPTwKH3Nad6y", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma5jG4hg3ZJh9CeWDX1rAMUfFzUX74v6S9kgt7zhua8fv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUPBam6SfAXuJhXkAnKCuVMY1Hu9qgA3vTPTwKH3Nad6y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PjSbgyZs9GrjAViVi9koeR7iYZ9Cd6NiQ"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
