If so, then this card belongs to you. Sometimes when you want to make a decision, too many considerations will actually hinder your steps. This card will give you the courage to chase an opportunity.\n\nThe Fool is depicted as a naive clown. He always carried a bundle of his belongings on a stick (called a bindle) slung over his back. This bindle means experience. Meanwhile, the sun will light up your journey to something new. This little puppy represents a true friend you need, sometimes it will bark loudly (to remind you of the right path), but at the same time also be a supporter in your ups and downs.\n\nThe Fool is sometimes numbered 0 (the first) or XXII (the last) or may even be unnumbered. In almost all tarot games, The Fool is one of the most valuable cards.\n\n*This item is available only as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).
