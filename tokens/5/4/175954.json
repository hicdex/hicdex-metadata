John always had a dark side,he had already lost his faith in humanity ,in the past,and his faith in Gods. He used to believe the 'they' would save the planet,but then he lost all his faith in them when he saw what they did. The strange history of this planet was the cause of his troubled mind.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think ?\u201d asked Lucy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026  their history is complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there are 4 planets that were destroyed by the \u2018first\u2019 people?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said John as he looked at Lucy.\n\n\u201cI know the history of your planet,so I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Lucy.\n\n\u201cWe destroyed the \u2018first\u2019 planet.Then,2 of our race came here and destroyed the second planet,then 3 people came here and destroyed the third planet.
