But in the end, our personalities are formed by our experiences, be they positive or negative. Unfortunately, the negative experiences are usually the strongest ones.\n\nDo you know what it feels like to lose love? Of course, you do. Everybody does.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new, but each time and for each person, it\u2019s the collapse of their universe.\n\nLosing love is painful, and many people try to escape from pain in any affordable form of anesthesia. In this project I consciously investigate the emotions, giving them a visual and symbolic shape. I live my life through photography, converting my personal experience into pictures.\n\n_____\n\nNote to collectors: if you wish to get a high-resolution PDF, please contact me via Twitter @pleshkova_art \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqQhbuvf4Hf7xj513SoJa5hYUwYRTV8PTcHEqk19a274", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQXDDcNjtpgqDeEWFLFoaM38PGQkmNC6hkFF5wfSxXNw3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqQhbuvf4Hf7xj513SoJa5hYUwYRTV8PTcHEqk19a274", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1PD5te9YHyMfb86TQw6s7S3uyAecyYBu7a"], "tags": ["book", "photobook", "zine", "PDF", "darkNFT", "dark", "photo", "photography", "bw", "self-portrait", "love", "pain", "breakup", "pleshkova"], "extra": {}}
