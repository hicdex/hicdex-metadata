One edition was minted to represent each year that PR has lived under colonization by the US (not including the many years before by the Spanish)\nOn one side you see the wealthy business owners and politicians who are taking advantage of tax breaks and extracting wealth from the island with no intention of helping the people of the island.\nOn the other side you see the natives of the island, who are still trying to rebuild from the hurricane (with no assistance) , suffering through lack of healthy and affordable food, lack of housing, schools and hospitals closing, and fires caused by a destroyed power grid and corporate-American greed. You can also see the deforestation taking place on protected land and the clearing of beaches that are home to endangered sea turtles so that extravagant hotels, pools, and tourist attractions can be built. (all of which is illegal but nothing is done)\nBy purchasing this NFT you will be helping fund Spearit Bear in his mission to go to Puerto Rico and assist his people to protect the land and make the island self-sustaining through regenerative agriculture, green energy, and to manage finances and assets with crypto/NFTs.\nThis is the first piece minted on H=N by Spearit Bear\nMore pieces by Spearit Bear available at rarible.com/spearitbear\nspearitbear.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdaZ7b74cv7eT4jR16YBaEwbKgmXAUhsowsbzHKkvPA2A", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd6BWDAeRFzV5YkBXCNFtf34g2hczyb5afEJXbvVS77Aw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdaZ7b74cv7eT4jR16YBaEwbKgmXAUhsowsbzHKkvPA2A", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cKSQfBCWnWNaWUmRegR7BWHzkut5fJtUD"], "tags": ["puertorico", "island", "fire", "political", "expression"], "extra": {}}
