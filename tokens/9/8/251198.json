The images of this collection are elaborated by compacting components of space, time and intention. The algorithm generate images by crushing cinematographic works. The generated image, a residual trace of time, synthesizes in a colorful atmosphere the history of the original movie. The process, like the mining of some crypto assets, need a long time of computer calculation and it's value can also be indexed on electrical energy.\n\nThis image is the residual trace of the movie \"Tenet\" by Christopher Nolan in 2020.\n\nImage properties: 6000x2733 px, 150dpi, .png, printable", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR9L8zWuQ5pJC3x76KxKepgQffNUE5MavGX3yYadM5SqL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVivmasuATQao1j9qQ5CGmm4vAKyprEn65V8TYmdx1ptg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR9L8zWuQ5pJC3x76KxKepgQffNUE5MavGX3yYadM5SqL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SzTsJNtuHjitQqchKko1n18o3NBVnCpGk"], "tags": ["image", "generate", "algorithm", "abstract", "color", "remix", "movie", ""], "extra": {}}
