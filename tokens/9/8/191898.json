Longboarders prefer \u201cC\u201d Street as it has a long, soft right. This GIF was created by videoing a surfer there. Further up the beach about 300 yards is a point break with a shorter but faster break. And then another 500 yards in the river mouth where it is more typical beach break except for the sandbar created by the river\u2019s flow.  The GIF is of a longboarder dropping five on the nose.  Below that is a short, four line, rhyming  poem about the surfer.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPcLxK8pn9tatrnqMdPciy9JpViW5SNNXa9kjFJ68nw9T", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPcLxK8pn9tatrnqMdPciy9JpViW5SNNXa9kjFJ68nw9T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPcLxK8pn9tatrnqMdPciy9JpViW5SNNXa9kjFJ68nw9T", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZeEcz8hStoqAKKC8BrC5hP6RqK8po3dwM"], "tags": ["Sports", "surfing", "surfer", "nature", "ocean", "beach", "sea", "waves", "outdoors", "athlete"], "extra": {}}
