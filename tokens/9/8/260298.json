Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "ART takes many forms, including photography. Some of my favorite trading cards as a kid were the STAR WARS cards put out by Topps in the late 1970s, which my grandpa Lewis (RIP) would buy for me while he was picking up his cans of chewing tobacco. Those old Topps cards were often just photos from the set of the films, or even film stills of the movies! The ART was in choosing the image to put on the card. In the case of MY NFT trading card series, I like to mix full, finished art and sketchy line art and variations of finished pieces and, sometimes, just photographs that I've taken, as we see here!\n\nThis image was photographed (by me) last autumn at the Stonehenge replica at Maryhill, Washington. I was lucky to be there near sunset, and I got a nice, mystical looking shot of the sun \"setting\" on one of the stone columns! ---Richard F.
