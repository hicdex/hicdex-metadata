Please Stand By, While USA Overturns Roe v Wade. Last week the supreme court upheld new abortions laws in Texas that would deny women the right to an abortion once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. This is regardless of circumstances, rape etc. As long as a heartbeat can be detected an abortion cannot be performed. Even worse Texas has setup an anonymous tip line for people to snitch on someone they may know performing or receiving illegal abortions. \nIn this lies Trump\u2019s real damaging lasting legacy, (much more than the polarization that was already there but he just made visible). A supreme court stacked with conservative judges that will allow states to impose their religious, moral wills on the people of their state.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicsnhclw5l2d76jtcuayl4wz2f4bswhrexqlhkthmjt2vgcppzuo4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiadgqq6hkgennigjboovyw6v7zljmoemouxs2b3kkmltmwadvlamm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicsnhclw5l2d76jtcuayl4wz2f4bswhrexqlhkthmjt2vgcppzuo4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
