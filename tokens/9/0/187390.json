They both have started working separately on material included in this album since the beginning of global covid19 pandemic in 2020. In December of 2020 Yura started learning from Stanislav all things about making electronic music, and building his own studio and music setup with help of Stanislav. During this time they became friends and in the beginning of March 2021 they organically started collaborating on this album, merging their art and music into One and creating new music and visuals together. This album includes 30 audio-visual loops that will be minted on Yura\u2019s favorite cryptoart platforms: on SuperRare, Hic et Nunc, KnownOrigin, Foundation, MakersPlace and Rarible during the minting marathon starting on June 21st and ending on July 30, 2021. This album covers a wide range of topics related to outer space exploration and the artist's inner reflection on what\u2019s being discovered there. Selected tracks from this \u039eSPAC\u039e are scheduled for vinyl release on Muscut label in 2022.
