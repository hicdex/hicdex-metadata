{"__version": 1, "token_id": 271090, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ButchVsMelody_WAV", "description": "412Lost+Found is a musical project diving into chronic PTSD trauma healing. Instead of an album, 412Lost+Found exists as paper scraps of scattered musical tokens dedicated to specific traumatic moments. To take those broken pieces of my psyche and use them to paint a soundscape of unspeakable trauma and torture that truly cannot be expressed through simple common language.\n\n\"ButchVsMelody_WAV\" is a captured token of the final moments of receiving relentless in-person death threats, 4 days night and day; the guy never slept to stop. At the very end of sitting there and just taking it we finally make sure there's an object between the both of us, and I sing in a fortissiissimo heavy vibrato operettic voice \"You think you're special? You think you're unique? You're not the first to treat me like a freak.\" and he was so enraged two people quickly stepped in front of both of us so that he doesn't try to kill me, and I just turn around and walk away.\n\n4 editions exist, one for each 24 hour period of relentless death threats I received from this Bitch. If you want the entire 412Lost+Found collection this is going to prove to be one of the more difficult parts to own. But maybe that's part of what makes this project so great: the scarcity is wildly variable, as is most of my art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidaj5ycziqz7k5gmwfi2kf3saywhxtv7zs2xcxv2mlgj36fb5rruy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidj4s7cytu3cv3dbjpi6lrnwmwa7lguthnboordrgwkwxdjnqcax4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidaj5ycziqz7k5gmwfi2kf3saywhxtv7zs2xcxv2mlgj36fb5rruy", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1PqogZ7ELvjZrVaAcM2sqKKrYNgm67pSVt"], "tags": ["412Lost+Found", "mothtasia", "mothtasiasynergism", "deaththreats", "butch", "verses", "melody", "soundtoken", "ptsd"], "extra": {}}
