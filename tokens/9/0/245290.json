{"__version": 1, "token_id": 245290, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "layers i / natural", "description": "We all are made up of layers. Feelings, thoughts, external stimuli, conversations we've had, experiences we've lived, hopes, wishes, frustrations, everything.\u00a0 Layers are made up of elements. The way they are arranged shape us.\n\nIf these elements are re-arranged, there's a new us.\nIf these layers can be read separately, there's a new understanding of us.\n\nThis is a series made up of 5 works, representing what we see in our natural state, and other ways of seeing and understanding, plus a 6th work that presents them all together.  Layers i is the first group of 6 works.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro.
