Actually NFTs haven\u2019t existed in years. They were converted to Galact=k SunRa tokens with a special Interstellar Space I.S. Wallet in the year 3026. I won\u2019t bore you with the details. You folks back on earth just started minting NFTs, and as I understand the party is just getting started. One piece of unsolicited advice from 5075: Keep minting your digital assets and supporting each other. You will be rewarded beyond your imagination. \nThis is the operations control room here on cargo ship Meadowsweet. I know, \u201cit\u2019s a digital version.\u201d The Federation doesn\u2019t allow cameras these days. And that\u2019s ok I guess. It\u2019s not like we are into cattle rustling and train heists! Hmmmm\u2026 wait we actually do like those. They\u2019re good for business. \n\nKeep on flyin\u2019....Love, Enoch\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbDa2mATg9YUjZzZxuHKe2sjoKKoCU1hpePXtLPVEGUbx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTKbkC5o9mApMr2qGgVHqcF13UjXQEoZJscYJdCpAbF8f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbDa2mATg9YUjZzZxuHKe2sjoKKoCU1hpePXtLPVEGUbx", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz2GP2o3kMJ8Q22FdjBo6QeheqUTAyEkHBo4"], "tags": ["bladerunner", "cyberpunk", "enoch", "spaceship", "scifi", ""], "extra": {}}
