The unlimited potential of outcomes in fractal Art is truly astounding.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiabj3awuwruvnkhrvky5jn4dvi7jyjkhlaudj3r3kedfrnagtho5q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiempqdf6ge65iqlcjme34osrpghq5hzbmv3hbjkzcxeyd6b4aayee", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiabj3awuwruvnkhrvky5jn4dvi7jyjkhlaudj3r3kedfrnagtho5q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1acsjcCfbZYeWzkR53xG9otkFRrbHAfAQ9"], "tags": ["waves", "blue", "contained", "art", "fractalart", "fractal", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
