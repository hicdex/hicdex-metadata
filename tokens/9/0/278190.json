The user can (but does not have to) take control of the drawing by modifying the algorithm through its graphical representation (\"the machine\") and by setting size and brightness of the pen.\n\nBased on the mathematical principle of the Fourier series.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- The work reacts to keyboard input only after the first click into the canvas or a hit of the [return key].\n- Sound on! Click once into the canvas to start sound.\n\nThis piece has a DRAW and an EDIT mode. Toggle between them using the [return key].\n\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| Take control in DRAW mode                                |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n  Enter EDIT mode                               [return key]  \n\n  Toggle DYNAMIC BRIGHTNESS                              [b]\n\n  Change PEN SIZE                              [mouse wheel]\n\n  DELETE drawing                               [right-click]\n  \n  Graceful END                                   [space bar]\n\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| Take control in EDIT mode                                |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n  Return to DRAW mode                           [return key]\n  \n\nWhile mouse cursor is placed outside of any object:\n\n  ADD or REMOVE segments                       [mouse wheel]\n  \n  Change PEN SIZE                                    [+] [-]\n\n\nWhile mouse cursor is placed over the center of a circle:\n\n  Change segment RADIUS                        [mouse wheel] \n                                 or [hold left mouse button]\n\n  Change segment SPEED                               [+] [-]\n\n\nPlace mouse cursor over the pen, then:\n\n  Change PEN SIZE                              [mouse wheel]\n  \n  Change PEN BRIGHTNESS                              [+] [-]\n\n  MOVE somewhere else                       [click and drag]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNe4jqwycxLzjnU85zGVYn6gTe2YPksaxcoCPghHCxaZ7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNRMKFvVDvkD9qHAehTiTdkiqMFzXgBC61cwMKr95RXES", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmR6ZYLUJuEziZGQ3XQ9kBNQQJELSdLZGDAHfG9YLrYSAs", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNe4jqwycxLzjnU85zGVYn6gTe2YPksaxcoCPghHCxaZ7", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1d2noVsT3TEM5tbgQHDof44TihCU5Vax6L"], "tags": ["random", "generative", "monochrome", "p5js", "interactive", "mathematics", "Fourier"], "extra": {}}
