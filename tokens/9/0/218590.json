Protests took place in Kabul and the Nangarhar, Khost and Kunar provinces.\nIn the city of Asadabad, Kunar province the protestors were fired upon by Taliban militants and several were killed.\nThis piece is intended as an act of solidarity with those protestors. \n\nSparkles of paint in colors of the Afghan tricolor are painted onto a white canvas. The paint here is not held to any borders.  The paint reveals the emblem and the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, but also spreads the colors around the canvas.\nWriggling white paints attempt to turn the flag white again but they can never win and if anything they simply make the flag more vibrant and alive, here also they ensure the shape and integrity of the flag remains visible.
