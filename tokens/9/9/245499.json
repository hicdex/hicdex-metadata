Feelings, thoughts, external stimuli, conversations we've had, experiences we've lived, hopes, wishes, frustrations, everything.\u00a0 Layers are made up of elements. The way they are arranged shape us.\n\nIf these elements are re-arranged, there's a new us.\nIf these layers can be read separately, there's a new understanding of us.\n\nThis is a series made up of 5 works, representing what we see in our natural state, and other ways of seeing and understanding, plus a 6th work that presents them all together.\u00a0 Layers i is the first group of 6 works.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro.
