I had a dream where I was being attacked by Nazis and Jason (he rose out of the water and everything).  Then I remember running and I see Freddy.  And he sees me and points at me with his claw.  So I turn around and start running the other way (back towards Jason and the Nazis).  Then in a typical movie fashion, I trip and fall.  I look back and Freddy is leaning down towards me with he claw finger.  He pushes it into my chest.  Then I wake up feeling a stinging feeling in my chest.  That was right after the Jason Vs Freddy movie came out. \nEnjoy.  www.theguidingrock.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYjx2auT95P5VRLbK3kmdGDd7rGsKYBEgShijMxDdLfdn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYjx2auT95P5VRLbK3kmdGDd7rGsKYBEgShijMxDdLfdn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYjx2auT95P5VRLbK3kmdGDd7rGsKYBEgShijMxDdLfdn", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hnmpvKPDDnXfh9tkE2ouWG2rP3uaUVjC4"], "tags": ["fear4hen", "freddykrueger", "nightmareonelmst", "horror", "psychedelic", "animation", "guidingrock"], "extra": {}}
