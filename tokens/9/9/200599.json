{"__version": 1, "token_id": 200599, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OBJKTs (Mondrian Edition)", "description": "This interactive OBJKT queries the hic et nunc contract on the Tezos blockchain to obtain the latest number of OBJKTs minted and will render the artwork with a series of bars representing each of the digits of that number. (Full vertical bar = 0)\n\nIt makes these queries without the use of 3rd-party web APIs (previously this was the only way to achieve this), technically making it a more resilient NFT. Instead, it communicates directly with Tezos RPC nodes using an embedded Taquito JS library, and is programmed to cycle through 2 popular community-run nodes (SmartPy and Tezos Giga Node from Tezos Ukraine) should one of them fail. \n\nThis is a Piet Mondrian-inspired edition.\n\nClicking anywhere randomizes the colors | Made in p5js | Created: 10 August 21 | Artist: @Yazid", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmae8XoyUZnb99YEu1tthfCB6mpnMGR3tZyb8pmojiKGb6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbBBR53jajn5mio3K3rbb75SA23QLkvKqvuyRGbt57S4x", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmeNqSXN4FNkRTvQiiiP1A2ESh1dHQR8mHUVzTGoBisRaq", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmae8XoyUZnb99YEu1tthfCB6mpnMGR3tZyb8pmojiKGb6", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1QgjmhrUD3X7kgS9mMHbUz4cS6uDiFGhAU"], "tags": ["abstract", "experimental", "generativeart", "interactive", "taquito", "tezos", "p5js", "yazid"], "extra": {}}
