I wound up getting lost in his video collection. And Beverly Hills Cop was my favorite. I have seen the film over 50 times. Serge is my favorite character, and he just wants to give you an expresso with a lemon twist. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHZWWFmaFcI\n\n2) A pondering on the Mobius strip. \n\t- We all have a dark and a light side. If each self is on either side of a circle, going round and round....we will never see both facets of you. But if we TWIST the ground we are on, we can make sure our light and dark sides get the love they deserve and their time in the sun.  \n\n<3 @flipacadabra", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUkhWuFPUL3peFZDn8e6VxKnXFcDV2nVtPPAXEPZ86QRf", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmem3oRrx5HC92ZKH737J8ALwX52jz9pFRZ27cqmNtdyeZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUkhWuFPUL3peFZDn8e6VxKnXFcDV2nVtPPAXEPZ86QRf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Z3CgWqBQc5oTYbyRqPcSvt56TcMSzymFa"], "tags": ["BeverlyHillsCop", "Serge", "Skateboarding", "Lemon", "Mindset", "MentalHealth", "Looping", "flip"], "extra": {}}
