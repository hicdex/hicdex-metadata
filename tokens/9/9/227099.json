Meditation doesn't have to always be sitting in silence or Asana's. Sometimes it's just being present with what is going around you. Or maybe just watching these stones come up, change, and then disappear.\n\nRam Dass has definitely been an amazing teacher through my lifetime, and this is how he describes it.\n\n\"Our thoughts are always happening. Much like leaves floating down a stream... If you are standing by a river and a leaf floats by, you have your choice of following the leaf with your eye or keeping your attention fixed in front of you. The leaf floats out of your line of vision. Another leaf enters\u2026and floats by. But as we stand on the bank of the river and the leaves float by, there is no confusion as to whether or not we are the leaves. Similarly, it turns out that there is a place in our minds from which we can watch our own mental images go by. We aren\u2019t our thoughts any more than we are the leaves.\"- Ram Dass", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSFHi6ZLVi56yGUnPiRBW3JPhXT72a4Y8zQ6k4E179Zq4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTMTBsr8MWpbg8xpsVHZwh5qHkUv7fLdrSmJ3jDjHbzTL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSFHi6ZLVi56yGUnPiRBW3JPhXT72a4Y8zQ6k4E179Zq4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ywq6RdMVaNvTqd6dATq562qfbyqZouv9Y"], "tags": ["Rocks", "Crystals", "Meditation", "SlowYourMind", "Leaf", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue", "RamDass", "Underwater", ""], "extra": {}}
