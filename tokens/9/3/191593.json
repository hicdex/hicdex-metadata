{"__version": 1, "token_id": 191593, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Virtual contact", "description": "On July 30 2021, when living legend William Gibson himself took the time to appreciate and share my artwork \"Diving into Cyberspace\" (hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/188000), a tribute to his famous Neuromancer, I was both in awe and humbled. His influential writings blew my mind as a teen, and changed my life by making me dream of a career in AR and VR.\n\nThis brief digital encounter is far from the Cyberspace interactions that William Gibson envisioned in Neuromancer 37 years ago, but to me it is the utmost validation. I am deeply honored by such an endorsement, which feels like a life goal achievement when I wasn't even remotely thinking of such a possibility.\n\nI decided to mint this virtual contact on the blockchain, using the most clean and punk platform available today, in an attempt to show my gratitude, and to make it last as long as possible.\n\ntwitter.com/fdoganis/status/1421148035934035971\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qman1m3RTdW8arEY8p5WLYDUogWqsP2vYVs9i836zBwvH3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU4KPBQw9CDTV98JVnJANSfZnDvRqyV98o3S7W7tH24Bi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qman1m3RTdW8arEY8p5WLYDUogWqsP2vYVs9i836zBwvH3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TQ3Gi42BHwJvNCDLGFVXxYcn4p9AkrvRC"], "tags": ["Cyberspace", "cyberpunk", "virtualreality", "vr", "matrix", "Neuromancer", "WilliamGibson", "Gibson", "fdoganis", "tweet", "twitter"], "extra": {}}
