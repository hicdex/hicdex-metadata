The core idea was conceived in 1988 (see artist's website) and was resumed in May 2021. The latest version works on the hue, saturation, and lightness of 1024x1024 points and has further simplified rules. A square is colored at random and divided into four parts. Each part can undergo a random color transformation between: (1) acquisition of an adjacent color and (2) random variation of color components. The subdivision and changes are applied recursively down to the single point. | Image generated on 2021-07-25T05:47:50Z and scaled to 4096x4096 pixels w/o interpolation | Antonio Belluscio @livinbits", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW8fjWKEJ8PPptDEukzP5ZiED4qdfHQqEkYALzNTyWFPP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNoV2o73hh7AS6xHj9X5MzUD8nfL6KxH1xe6dMVuA3Z9H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW8fjWKEJ8PPptDEukzP5ZiED4qdfHQqEkYALzNTyWFPP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PAoZ7RxQrvvC2ceyVR7YGKFmgyLxs1ZEH"], "tags": ["diviso4", "diviso4hsl", "generated", "pixels", "generativeArt", "codeArt", "algorithmicArt", "creativeCoding", "red", "brown", "orange", "pareidolia", "random", "generative", "procedural", "recursive", "recursion", "fractal"], "extra": {}}
