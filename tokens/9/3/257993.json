On September the third 2013 exactly 8 years ago I found this piece of film on the corner of S\u00fclzburgstr./Emmastr. in Cologne. It's been in a moving box almost the entire time. I have no idea why it looks the way it looks and what happened to it and to whom it belongs. In no way had I had any artistic input in its outcome. I only scanned it. And now I will sell this scan on this platform. It's TheOne I found and I never knew what to do with it. So this evening I will return it where I found it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaKsyGKWeuNVV117f95Z7epjqitegb3bHCEWycb1C7A8w", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVExC9DApvBUBJDBigY3iTSL25vd35vq1ECNiiTsqanTi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaKsyGKWeuNVV117f95Z7epjqitegb3bHCEWycb1C7A8w", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1X3no4bduuqSSE2AhhSq3yh9EGNFZJRR9X"], "tags": ["foundfootagecolognescan"], "extra": {}}
