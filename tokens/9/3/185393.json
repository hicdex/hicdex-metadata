Each NFT will use binary code for the title I to IOIOO (1 - 20). Each fractal will be animated with its own soundscape. I see the project as a metaphor for how many view the world in black or white, but if you look at the subject for any amount of time you will see shades of grey, multiple shapes and points of interest.\n\nWelcome to Binary II (Number 3 in Binary Code) ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmboAV5tvemse7JMiqwTVmJ1Pcb6JHKCe5n48F6G8hyCZ3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdg9CXiGtLFsUErQJ7JwVVvjGokJWeADzWSNTYxP72Uds", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmboAV5tvemse7JMiqwTVmJ1Pcb6JHKCe5n48F6G8hyCZ3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dm4LqGHWDWhzauate79Qc1yn6vATXGeXk"], "tags": ["Binaryseries", "#jointherush", "Binary", "Fractal", "Soundscapes", "Positive"], "extra": {}}
