He started exploring space in 1997. We see space as if it is empty or nothing's in there. But for sure, that\u2019s not the reality of the creator. \nSome strips may look alike but in every space, the creator guaranteed that there will be no totally identical strips/pieces. Like humans living in this space. Every existence has its own \ncolor, shape, energy, aura, and beauty! \n\nKAWALAN-02", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcsQ4yXgNS5FDpQTD41MDsWVZEpikWoBQTCTLs9xvFpU6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQEXohWHWWSF4Yy8V17andhVSg77gPz6jdvq7tif8umcP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcsQ4yXgNS5FDpQTD41MDsWVZEpikWoBQTCTLs9xvFpU6", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PztuURkUJcRYXixUUYaUpb6N9uyNQ456y"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "jakestudyos", "psychedelicart", "EXPLORATIONOFSPACE"], "extra": {}}
