They form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin for \"green \ud83e\udd22 plants\") that includes the flowering \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31 plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns, clubmosses, hornworts, liverworts, mosses \ud83c\udf43and the green \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22 algae, and excludes the red \ud83d\udc79 and brown \ud83d\udc34\ud83d\udc34 algae. Historically, plants\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31 were treated as one 1\ufe0f\u20e31\ufe0f\u20e3 of two \u270c\u270c kingdoms\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf7 including all living things that were not animals\ud83d\udc12\ud83d\udc12, and all algae and fungi\ud83c\udf32 were treated as plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae \ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria\ud83d\udc1e\ud83d\udc1e)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV1uaUE62G6rC6SxGDoqbnbU7RyikupCmQMzb8zXQCSNy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV1uaUE62G6rC6SxGDoqbnbU7RyikupCmQMzb8zXQCSNy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV1uaUE62G6rC6SxGDoqbnbU7RyikupCmQMzb8zXQCSNy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hGG6yMHeUXk13YzwjLiC6HRzfUpBSsjYb"], "tags": ["plants", "flower", "illustration", "digital", ""], "extra": {}}
