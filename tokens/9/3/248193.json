Do they too then become a kind of hybrid form of alien communication?\n\nAs Sun Ra once said: \u201cEverything comes from outer space...from unknown regions. Human life depends upon the unknown...knowledge is laughable when attributed to a human being.\u201d \n\nThe source material for this video portrait was originally captured by the artist in the Australian Outback, Hong Kong and Tokyo and remixed into various live A/V performances while touring internationally as Professor VJ.\n\n24-second video loop with sounds by Chad Mossholder.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYAm2Qied64KZB4MYfKLcQLETvy5e2DNZfrXtNEy9RJgX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRfvDF3ZupY3DviMsUDibTHpT5tTgp61urJZU23ws5Tan", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYAm2Qied64KZB4MYfKLcQLETvy5e2DNZfrXtNEy9RJgX", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hZVRcAHR15njYL5ZVSxBE8eN4pTuZR4xG"], "tags": ["video", "glitch", "poetry", "alien", "shadow", "sound", "noise", "outerspace", "cosmos", "color", "flicker", "signal", "conceptual", "pixel", "knowledge", "freaky", "art"], "extra": {}}
