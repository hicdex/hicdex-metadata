Beyond the grave is a pile of firewood for burning corpses, the land of ghosts or the underworld. Its ruler is Hades, whose name is also attributed to his dark realm. Because the dark world of the underworld contrasted with the bright and heavenly world of Olympus, Hades was often not considered an Olympian deity , and his attendants were never invited to a supper at the palace of Zeus.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTpzmkuxSQVCfJ2zBuAe3LpPYW6pgGmTJgKcdnV6vdPLw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmciDShyMnnDHXNCamveeT8xshM6CVtMWQXcbruxQbkobt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTpzmkuxSQVCfJ2zBuAe3LpPYW6pgGmTJgKcdnV6vdPLw", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UcUFDp1mhcjj1HkwB2bTKnH5R3EBtCsYG"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
