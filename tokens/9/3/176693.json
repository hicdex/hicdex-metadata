My art is my subjectivity.\n\nMy art makes me understand why I make abstracts the way that I do. Why do I prefer one direction over another?\n\nI look into my art as visual representations of how I am feeling and what my motivations are. There is a pathway in the image to different layers of what is unconscious.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m digging down or peeling back one thing after another to find the origins of my tastes and aesthetic, thinking about the things I\u2019ve made from furniture to sculpture from found objects, collage and painting. The music I\u2019ve listened to and the books I\u2019ve read are forming an orderly line through different phases of my history. \n\nI see that like most people I\u2019m endlessly looking for what it is that\u2019s behind everything. And for me now, these excavations are the art that I make.\n\nThe idea of a stripping back to the origins of something is, for me,  clearly signified in these works. They suggest a layering or a moving away from a surface. There are glimpses of one thing positioned behind another like memories hidden and suddenly revealed.  Colours that at once compliment and contrast seem to be expressions of ideas and memories vying for my attention.\n\nI make digital art with laptops, iPads, cameras and apps and I really strive to find the accidental amongst the ones and zeros. More specifically its not the accidents that I\u2019m looking for, it\u2019s that amazing sense of excitement that I get when, amongst the chaos that I\u2019ve created, what I've found suddenly and deafeningly resonates with something inside me and I have to stop. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZVHizQVSKQ1r8PVMzZfn7ByQMPvWAA6pHwMicNDfWdfM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmctG8v29vX7eWt6uAdZhLBd55d1hFkKVcadqDhTkpKsiG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZVHizQVSKQ1r8PVMzZfn7ByQMPvWAA6pHwMicNDfWdfM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NHP2mmBNbagWLLnaKM3C1QCtmuk2Qjg26"], "tags": ["Abstract", "1/1", "expressionism", "physical", "depth", ""], "extra": {}}
