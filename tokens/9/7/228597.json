B\u00e1thory was accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and women between 1590 and 1610. The highest number of victims cited during B\u00e1thory's trial was 650, despite the evidence against B\u00e1thory, her family's importance protected her from a death sentence. She was imprisoned in December 1610 within Castle of Csejte, in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia).\n\nThe stories of B\u00e1thory's sadistic serial murders are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Stories describing B\u00e1thory's\u00a0vampiric\u00a0tendencies, such as the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, were generally recorded years after her death, and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national\u00a0folklore, and her infamy persists to this day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNRcQwfVyc35dih5VqKVDmhP2QYJTCbY62frmyPNTqMg8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZRPCVBfgbHpaoAy1ZsUsevsoNmbQcfKzpfhuCPMuBoKU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNRcQwfVyc35dih5VqKVDmhP2QYJTCbY62frmyPNTqMg8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Collage", "theartofmann", "darkart", "bathory", "vampire", "Countess", "portrait", "surreal"], "extra": {}}
