{"__version": 1, "token_id": 181797, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GOOD TRIP (BLOOD TRIP SERIES #1 of 6)", "description": "You know how when you put a tab on your tongue, drink some mushroom tea, or pop a molly, and you are looking forward to feeling good and enjoying universal bliss? GOOD TRIP is all about celebrating the pleasant splintering of reality that we experience when everything goes right on psychedelics.\n\nSometimes, though, we get more than we expected. The rest of this series depicts the heroic journey we may find ourselves on when we are gripped by the unknown forces we encounter during a trip that takes us to places we did not anticipate.\n\nFirst in a series of six, and the only piece you can purchase. You will receive the other five for free. Plus, one collector will be randomly selected to be gifted a 1/1 edition of the frozen blood macro photography shot that was the sole input for all the images in this series.\n\n2238x3968 JPG\n\nMinted July 24th, 2021.
