She did so despite the best efforts of race director Jock Semple, who tried to forcibly remove her from the course. Photos of the altercation landed in newspapers around the world, and in the years that followed, Switzer became a crusader for women\u2019s sports, as well as a noted journalist, author, and TV commentator. Switzer won the New York City Marathon in 1974 and placed second at the Boston Marathon the following year, and she was a moving force in the effort to include the women\u2019s marathon as an Olympic event.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNrPe5mNjHDEJksqRffZcBdd94PxL21nCtv2XeKVATdAF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbbbeezW9UViK2p5CB97v6jqRqgnhJmscxjSLdD86qTsp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNrPe5mNjHDEJksqRffZcBdd94PxL21nCtv2XeKVATdAF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
