That sleeper train was the begging of Thailand Journey with my friend. So this is not perfect photo but it is perfect to begin with this project. I woke up bit earlier while my friend was still asleep. I still remember how I felt when I saw that view. \n\n#HENphoto365dayz project \nMint a photo 7dayz a week for 356dayz a year. From 3rd September(Fri)2021 to 2nd September(Fri)2022.
