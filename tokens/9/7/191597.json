Blankets not only wrap up from the cold; they wrap up personal losses, human emotions and broken lives. Besides being objects to be used, blankets are usually objects made, from a line of yarn to a whole flexible surface but also they are made when carefully mended in times of partial destruction. There is a particular beauty in this making practice, since the body through repetitive and togethering gestures projects its own personal shelter - life is organized in this textile making.\u201d\n\u2013 Tania P\u00e9rez-Bustos\n\n\nTania P\u00e9rez-Bustos researches technologies of doing and caring.
