{"__version": 1, "token_id": 209497, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "persia", "description": "\"persia\" is the 2nd song off my new beattape \"souls\" releaseing August 27, 2021. The song was inspired by an album I found digging for records in a shop in Shanghai. It was a Persian record that was composed by a Japanese duo. I listened to the music and knew right away that I was going to buy it and sample it when I get home. \n\nthe cover art was generated by AI using the text prompt \"ancient adventures to the East\" My girlfriend recommended prompt and the AI spit out a perfect piece. \n\nBop your head and enjoy the music. If you purchase this piece, hit me up on twitter @ryanartwalker and I will send you the album with high quality WAV files!
