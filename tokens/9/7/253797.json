In the Circular Artifacts series, this process is repeated, but ignores the finality of the bounding box - lines are drawn continuously until the circle is filled.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbZaLCLdy1TajMbbNghqDYneG1YNgxf3hfnR5BVCHeUom", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSsa4JbDNMrAG2Jt3crqPmk6pXRCVMvBVCtNkiVHpv6ny", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbZaLCLdy1TajMbbNghqDYneG1YNgxf3hfnR5BVCHeUom", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "circle", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "digitaldrawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
