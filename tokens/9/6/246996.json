After a 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the road, its main street ends to an area we call \"Sahara\". Sahara consists of empty lands, gardens or fields of green. In some of those fields, people recently have planted saffron, other parts are mainly vegetables like tomatoes, onions or cucumbers.\nBut some magical parts of ground are not planted and not empty. They are filled with random weeds. It feels like a beautiful improvisation, yet sometimes so careful as work of a thoughtful farmer.\nIn Sahara, weeds are strong forces. They grow wherever they want to. Although they are not individually significant, they come together and make a whole.\nSince childhood, I always loved and noticed them. They speak to me, when the wind blows.\n( 120mm analog photography)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYnxsmydwGKZZAGcgzrgJJEWWab5MVNHqsU2fp5cYaDpY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeaGhzHgm45dzuD2dByFo294MtALeLBE6DJ6b7UFNWXm8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYnxsmydwGKZZAGcgzrgJJEWWab5MVNHqsU2fp5cYaDpY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "Photo", "Weed", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "120mm", "BW", "nature"], "extra": {}}
