It's an increasingly popular alternative darkroom technique and it captures the imagination of many. What I intend to conjure in the chemigram may not be what I see and is usually not what others see. In that way, the chemigram, is a medium of self reflection and discovery.\n\nMade on traditional light sensitive silver gelatine photographic paper. For \"\uff54\uff48\uff45 \uff54\uff48\uff49\uff52\uff44 \uff4f\uff4e\uff45\" (my third NFT) it was 8x10 inch resin coated gloss black and white Ilford paper) with photographic developer and fixer. The tones, colours, shapes, textures, lines, composition, forms and spaces are the consequence of careful, careless and random control over how, when and in what context the photochemical reaction occurs. For \"\uff54\uff48\uff45 \uff54\uff48\uff49\uff52\uff44 \uff4f\uff4e\uff45\", sodium hydroxide pellets, an extremely potent base, was used to form this image.\n\nThe movement is something unique to the NFT. The chemigram, like a traditional photograph is static. The NFT, like all new mediums, allows for a different mode of expression. Introducing movement in the final image makes a dynamic, energetic, calming, violent and/or psychedelic experience. There is many different digital avenues to explore that can be captured effectively by the NFT.\n\nUltimately, producing a chemigram with movement in mind is the next step in this process.\n\nThere is only one copy of \"\uff54\uff48\uff45 \uff54\uff48\uff49\uff52\uff44 \uff4f\uff4e\uff45\".", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRgG8ejNhvud1KuG4PR9RFSgeiVKE5bG9kSWEH1WvsdJ8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaxPZvsUY8w6r9LaNP3AufhVAKuk49ZPWaxpH1NH5idXt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRgG8ejNhvud1KuG4PR9RFSgeiVKE5bG9kSWEH1WvsdJ8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZY6ToHLL7Ydhkapu5qDAvqhzP5Zp6tBP8"], "tags": ["chemigram", "abstract", "expressionism", "darkroom", "Ilford", "sodiumhydroxide"], "extra": {}}
