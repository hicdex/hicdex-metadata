{"__version": 1, "token_id": 254996, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Preternatural Sunset", "description": "I love to walk on the broad walk towards Sandown Castle in Deal at dusk. Sandown Castle was an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII in 1540, it was mostly destroyed by the late 1800s. The view of this sunset from the ruins across the golf course was spectacular. An orange glow with the warning of storms to come the following day.\n\nI saw this sunset and painted it a month later, no photo or other visual references. Just memory. I try to paint the feeling, the chill in the air, the orange glow, the lush green of the golf course, the flowers on the bank of the castle ruins and the dark clouds high in the sky.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTHTHfBt1GKNi9ukNTverXPzXAHwBjJmYDQttHarDHrJW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmceQsw1FX74C1nA56HDCUBUxcNL8XQmJ8AKKC3Se1W7Et", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTHTHfBt1GKNi9ukNTverXPzXAHwBjJmYDQttHarDHrJW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Sunset", "Watercolor", "Watercolour", "Painting", "StephanieFuller"], "extra": {}}
