Although the mushrooms are inky caps, they do not have gills that liquefy. These gregarious little fungi occur from early spring until the onset of winter, and they are at their most spectacular when the caps are young and pale - sometimes nearly pure white. It takes just two or three days for young white caps to turn grey and then begin blackening.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeao67urQSQn4hDAMnLGqwvnrFewn7dSDvouit1WXyAHW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmeao67urQSQn4hDAMnLGqwvnrFewn7dSDvouit1WXyAHW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeao67urQSQn4hDAMnLGqwvnrFewn7dSDvouit1WXyAHW", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
