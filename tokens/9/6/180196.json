Though big, there aren't many photos about its details and meanders. It's yellow since the 19th century, as depicted by the painter Victor Meirelles.\nToday, such as this model, it's a story driven monument, and I dare to open up this Eberbach Abbey by modifying some cultural aspects of the windowpanes amongst other conscious changes.\nIt is a shrouded monument because it's mostly used by the locals on political and History making moments. The peaceful and charitable Catholics that keep it running stand high with it over the centuries old trees at the park downtown.\n\nThis is the first mint of the Shrouded Landmarks collection, which seeks to present models of less known monuments and landmarks, as philosopher Walter Benjamin found Paris's archways more interesting than the ones representing idealist military victories.\n\nTwitter @pedioscorides Ig @pdioscorides", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZGM6LqFa4B8ptq6eoWPfpyyAqhACofkgXUN7BUV5pFNw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX8T2KfpQg7Qhe74uueuD2dqymk6U6xd1pwkrfGPDpCXs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZGM6LqFa4B8ptq6eoWPfpyyAqhACofkgXUN7BUV5pFNw", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1Nf8mQBpnaxK374yUbMLuUreYKughgwsaQ"], "tags": ["glb", "model", "3d", "speculative", "architecture", "History", "Brazil", "India", ""], "extra": {}}
