It's a relatively quiet place surrounded by nice neoclassical architecture. That day I was giving a street photography class and this scene came in handy. The happy rich couple was completely oblivious while the homeless guy was completely aware but not at all interested. Shot 18 October 2014. Coordinates: -23.5482124,-46.6332289.
