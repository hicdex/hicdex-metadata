Instead of an album, 412Lost+Found exists as paper scraps of novelty musical tokens dedicated to specific traumatic moments. To take those broken pieces of my psyche and use them to paint a soundscape of unspeakable trauma and torture that truly cannot be expressed through simple common language.\n\n\"ButchVsMelody_WAV\" is a captured token of the final moments of receiving relentless in-person death threats, 4 days night and day; the guy never slept to stop. At the very end of sitting there and just taking it we finally make sure there's an object between the both of us, and I sing in a fortissiissimo heavy vibrato operettic voice \"You think you're special? You think you're unique? You're not the first to treat me like a freak.\" and he was so enraged two people quickly stepped in front of both of us so that he doesn't try to kill me, and I just turn around and walk away.\n\n4 editions exist, one for each 24 hour period of relentless death threats I received from this Bitch.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVqGB8hSxiamKojKRkQ758Zaaws2fJLiC7HYA3zw737WF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTcmKUmMsBGaE4waVDZWb267kx1xpCbaL4eeEooT17Nqw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVqGB8hSxiamKojKRkQ758Zaaws2fJLiC7HYA3zw737WF", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1cuFskjycaNE3JJDk2iVgHMfaEqCUJZ5wb"], "tags": ["cptsd", "ptsd", "traumarecovery", "mothtasia", "mothtasiasynergism", "novelty", "412Lost+Found"], "extra": {}}
