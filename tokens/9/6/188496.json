The sofa was definitely special and the leather from which it was made created unusual textures. The leather folds of the sofa created different shapes that looked like many figures. It was just required to photograph it from every possible direction. After some editing, these characters just came to life.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYyUijdBF4vY2hP2jfMUasJ2ejdG3QMUYz8yHvQnT2cD1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYDJzRzZve68ViEHmjqT1d7yrJ5oWfFLfSs3F53Ea48nw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYyUijdBF4vY2hP2jfMUasJ2ejdG3QMUYz8yHvQnT2cD1", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZuXpzkdPKxGupK5CFM1zHPDtGh1PD9BKK"], "tags": ["Pillow", "Sofa", "Leather", "Digitalart", "Photography", "Fineart", "creatures", "madness", "Darkness", "Alien"], "extra": {}}
