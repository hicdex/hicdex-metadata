{"__version": 1, "token_id": 217292, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Fisherman ", "description": "The fisherman is a photograph of a Dominican fisherman I would see going out to fish every morning at sunup. The photograph catches him returning at the end of his day. It reminded me of the old man and the sea. There is a great deal of moisture in the air by the beach, and it makes shooting dull sometimes. Fortunately, I got lucky with this photograph and shot this photo on a dry day. The Caribean colors are beautiful but often do not translate into photography.
