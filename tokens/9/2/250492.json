Nonetheless, as specimens now with new user names, they are captured again.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbP3uWaZbBzfdgchC9g1dbRJWP7ELCnTxvqQyYrC5RvZA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW3CmpLt3dwjKLSMnp3YRaV2CjZ4HUaUTd8yR1A3yoPGY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbP3uWaZbBzfdgchC9g1dbRJWP7ELCnTxvqQyYrC5RvZA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XR6K5u8atyJGJjm6EawvnwGq7odbMKmzQ"], "tags": ["gan", "generativeart", "ganart", "generative", "past", "present", "future", "machinelearning", "neuralnetwork", "contemporaryart", "digitalart", "modernart", "surrealism", "surreal", "aiart", "jettroxx", "memory", "untitledmemories", "popart", "photomanipulation"], "extra": {}}
