There are 14 pieces in total.\n\nFluid art painting is an abstract art form that uses acrylic paints with a liquid (fluid) consistency. Layers of acrylic paint are poured into a mug, which then react with each other when combined to create free-flowing organic abstract compositions.\n\nWhen poured onto canvas or surface, the imbalance of different densities of paint creates interesting and visually impressive reactions. And with the combination of different colors pieces of a special beauty are achieved.\n\nThe NFT comes with the high resolution image in a size of 2700x4000 pixels. You can download this image and print it poster size to decorate your home.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiapqfxw35xdals5lakqhyij6jdgxtzy7sw6oug4nchqpvnwbcfioq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibnnfyasvl4knrynlk7j47w3xsqezu3keaeefzlut7plobam4z5gq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiapqfxw35xdals5lakqhyij6jdgxtzy7sw6oug4nchqpvnwbcfioq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1T8iXzMzGf8xW4dQFHmM7yH2C8MV4khJyn"], "tags": ["fluid", "painting", "organic", "colorfull", "special", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
