The earth is angry and damaged itself because it is tired of the thoughts and things that humans have done to the earth.\n\n         The wall that used to stand tall is now only a few meters away and the wall that used to be called the tallest building is now just soil and eroded by water, a sign of life on the new earth is very unlikely or 0.0000001% for a life on earth that is new.\n\n          Before life appeared, at night the rain appeared after several years of waiting for it, after life ended the rain appeared and One morning there was an artificial human who was still fully formed and only a few scratches all over the body, the artificial human we can call, get the friction of the heat of the earth and the rain water and during the day made the artificial man wake up because of the water and the heat of the sun after a few years and a new life emerged but this is very different from the initial life and there is no real human there is only an artificial human made from various steel and cables made before the earth destroyed itself due to human activities.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbSHboJ8xLnvjQAKPGQejqnvxv9acjHadmFkP5Gp5H1rB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPoEUQ3a7BtTXRwLxxeWnZwcJp2xFNAhnBD7TMuNr2gf6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbSHboJ8xLnvjQAKPGQejqnvxv9acjHadmFkP5Gp5H1rB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RU6ps9pj2d4Lr933Zf3Xi1yehPDfpTYRw"], "tags": ["JJJorza", "jeanne", "artwork", "beautiful", "tezos", "hicetnunc", "3dart", ""], "extra": {}}
