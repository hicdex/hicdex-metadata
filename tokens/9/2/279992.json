{"__version": 1, "token_id": 279992, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Homage to Hiroshi Kawano", "description": "Interactive homage to the Markov chain-based work of Hiroshi Kawano (1925-2012).\n\nDrop an image on the canvas to pixelate it into a grid with a color palette taken from Kawano. A probabilistic Markov Random Field model is then created of the image from the von Neumann neighborhoods (with a Manhattan distance of 1) of all the cells in the 40 x 40 cell grid.\n\nKawano originally worked with Markov chain models of sequences of cells instead of their two-dimensional analogs, MRF, that are used here.\n\nCells in the grid are then replaced iteratively in accordance with the probabilities in the MRF model, in a process I call Markovian drift. That is, cells are allowed to be determined by their closest neighbors to the left, top, right and bottom.\n\nPress [V] to replace cells from left to right, [H] to replace cells from top to bottom, or [R] to replace cells in random order.\n\nPress [Space] or left click to pause. Press [Return] to reset to initial grid.\n\nOpen edition for 30 days.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZvsXcjBQogoFRfq1ok2azhp9w7u5TY9rd6zuRhe7mMwA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZaU32YBQs6voJAnHe9Qnt3HJfbhSQk4MeVxccKSGqceX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZaU32YBQs6voJAnHe9Qnt3HJfbhSQk4MeVxccKSGqceX", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZvsXcjBQogoFRfq1ok2azhp9w7u5TY9rd6zuRhe7mMwA", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WDJV8EC2WRegrn2W6A68RmZLyfZP8tzwJ"], "tags": ["interactive", "generative", "p5.js", "kawano", "markov", "pixels", "grid"], "extra": {}}
