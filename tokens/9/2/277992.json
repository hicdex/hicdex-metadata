{"__version": 1, "token_id": 277992, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Head Hunting 03", "description": "A spin-off series of \"Good Natured Savages\"\n\nGAN portrait generated from public domain portraits of different members of pre-colonial Filipino ethnic groups, mostly from the Igorot, and Bagobo tribes.\n\nThe illustrations are inspired by the tattoos of the headhunters from the Igorot tribes. Tattoos worn by the men symbolized the number of human heads taken during a headhunting raid.\n\nThe chaklag tattoo, usually a design going upward from each chest, and curving outward to the shoulder and region of the upper arms, symbolizes the number of fresh trophy heads taken during inter-tribal raids and battles.\n\nThe tattoos are applied by tapping the needle made of a sharp piece of wood or thorn which was attached to a wood handle with a mallet. The tattoo ink was a mixture of tree resin and soot which was rubbed into the wound as the tattoo was applied.\n\nWhile many tattoos were for a certain accomplishment such as a fresh head taken, or possibly attaining the highest rank of chief, some tattoos were given for medicinal reasons as well. A small tattoo would be placed on the exact spot of illness such as a tumor or wounded area for therapeutic healing. Medicinal tattoos have been a practice that spans back thousands of years.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidr6mrdvxflfdabiwkdbvjovghnv72iiifptvn7u2s4q54rkrgceq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidr6mrdvxflfdabiwkdbvjovghnv72iiifptvn7u2s4q54rkrgceq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidr6mrdvxflfdabiwkdbvjovghnv72iiifptvn7u2s4q54rkrgceq", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1PsJYVfdvtk9TEBWu6xMDMsSn4zCnhvtvw"], "tags": ["gif", "philippines", "publicdomain", "portrait", "bagobo", "igorot", "ai", "filipino", "animation", "gan", "illustration", "aeta", "pre-colonial"], "extra": {}}
