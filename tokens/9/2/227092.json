He is portrayed as a lion with a red head, covered in white thick fur, and wearing gilded jewelry adorned with pieces of mirrors. The origins of the Barong are far back in time and quite uncertain. Its origins could be from animist worship, before Hinduism appeared, when villagers still believed in the supernatural protective power of animals. \n\nHe is the king of the spirits, leader of the hosts of good, and enemy of Rangda, the demon queen and mother of all spirit guarders in the mythological traditions of Bali. The battle between Barong and Rangda is featured in the Barong dance to represent the eternal battle between good and evil.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcVJ36o9RETQ9fFBLrUZbUjRJXCHq7RQaKcUq9Hx7hoaJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTcbbAYd5e5q5ourpnUnAdtrdEuHYc5py4oQBKXs4P2FY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcVJ36o9RETQ9fFBLrUZbUjRJXCHq7RQaKcUq9Hx7hoaJ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gvbhPvKaSeKkieEAUMqDB18Wkm4ECcSSG"], "tags": ["slim", "hicetnunc", "NFT", "NFTart", "NFTcollector", "NFTcommunity", "NFTartist", "Tezos", "Art", "CleanNFT", "NFTAsia", "Crypto", "Cryptoart", "cryptoartist", "bali", "culture", "indonesia", "barong", "illustration", "drawing", "digital", "digitalillustration"], "extra": {}}
