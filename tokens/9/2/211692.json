They tend to swarm around the center of the canvas and they will stop breeding once their population reaches a maximum (this maximum is relative to the size of the canvas).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaTdwoyxTwaYG1zeqMPNFmFvQJz2k9qZZL3ddxgBSGKLE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPTesGD1EJykwNQNUw8YBerq2uSbpkC1Qa3ZEQ1uXoC5t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmPTesGD1EJykwNQNUw8YBerq2uSbpkC1Qa3ZEQ1uXoC5t", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaTdwoyxTwaYG1zeqMPNFmFvQJz2k9qZZL3ddxgBSGKLE", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1iejkdRYyq7WdVtrXgpq1dtazsGpthkF1U"], "tags": ["generativeart", "p5js", "javascript", "bearism"], "extra": {}}
