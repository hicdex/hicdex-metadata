Got some light tears, the inner springs are saggier than a new mattress but it hasn't worn a bra since the 70's, so no surprise there. As clean as anything used on Craigslist during a pandemic. I will spritz some disinfectant on it before pickup. I'm only getting rid of it because we downsized to a full. Text or email please. I probably won't answer phone calls.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaqechc53rdiyzz4igxivsziu5haxjcdyysinlxz5xvwsli7tna4a", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreickx5cord72nauhxtdwgt46yrqzgpd5cg5dni345g2xd3tefgqlra", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaqechc53rdiyzz4igxivsziu5haxjcdyysinlxz5xvwsli7tna4a", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1efdGLEg5QWhi6cwAMYGZZE2Vp9s89QSJs"], "tags": ["trash", "photography", "craigslist", "slo", "mattress"], "extra": {}}
