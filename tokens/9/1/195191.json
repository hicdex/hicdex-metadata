It is a heavy and barnacled chest of Mediterranean treasure that I shall open often, to giggle at its blazing eyes. I'm very much looking forward to your future works, and would like to pay tribute to your wonderful Tezos Pirates. Here is Treason Duke, making a statement on the philosophy that guides him.\n\nLove (pure),\nLittle Old Man\n\nThis is the unique 1/1 version of the piece, a personal gift to Flygohr, to be followed by an edition of 99 that is publicly available.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeM8TA8FfSK3M5tWEEtFbChWLqXCCaXWiMvKJHZbLMT6a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeM8TA8FfSK3M5tWEEtFbChWLqXCCaXWiMvKJHZbLMT6a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeM8TA8FfSK3M5tWEEtFbChWLqXCCaXWiMvKJHZbLMT6a", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1X87cbDabLp6P3Kz1cJ2UA2nq3U1XZV5oA"], "tags": ["HENPals", "illustration", "littleoldman", "HENpal", "flygohr", "tezospirates", "gift"], "extra": {}}
