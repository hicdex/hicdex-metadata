While they stood and waited I approached him and asked if I could take his photo. His eyes lit up and he said yes. I immediately mentioned my notebook to him and he said that was amazing and that he'd love to write for me. I took photos of his brother and son in the time he wrote. He encouraged his son to be open with me, since he wrote for me as well. In the few minutes I spoke with Christopher, I could feel the love and support he has for his son. It was amazing to meet a person that radiated so much positivity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifpbn2ugnl5fceeq5ev4qrimncetk266btddngzjraqlrtpb5pfwq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiajaczlgscy2bw6a5rzlt3dvd2l6pp5erpo3j2uiqnyquyoiubjya", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifpbn2ugnl5fceeq5ev4qrimncetk266btddngzjraqlrtpb5pfwq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
