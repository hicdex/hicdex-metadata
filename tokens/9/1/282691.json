I've got a message from a stranger, he gave me coordinates, and asked to be there at Friday 13, 1:00 AM. I went there, and found an envelope with flash-usb drive. Flash drive is labeled as \"Metalab\" and included folders with those creations, folders were called \"P\", \"S1\", \"S2\" etc. But folders were encrypted, and it takes time, to get files from them. I am working on it right now. Once those folders are decrypted, I'll upload leftover materials. I can't tell you a lot yet, what its all about, but the scraps of information that I was able to decipher, indicate that these files were used to program biorobots. Use it at your own risk.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiemi3c4q2qcf6enw7keyw55dfdhtb54fmtujjgt2yg6om4k5dt7ne", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifdfcyadjgwcconwfycdugdb5o3vp2foomg2kdypuzbxveletxepe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiemi3c4q2qcf6enw7keyw55dfdhtb54fmtujjgt2yg6om4k5dt7ne", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QKKFUeq9mM2baPTfSnzxbJ1Bw7prmvxKv"], "tags": ["OBJKT4OBJKT"], "extra": {}}
