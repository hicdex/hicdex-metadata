This image is from the middle of that feedback loop. I have slightly adjusted the colors and levels in order to better coordinate with the Variations.\n\nPlease note that this artwork was not sold on the primary market. It was minted exclusively as a gift for My pre-sale collectors who bought out over half of My collection in My first pre-sale. I am grateful to have so many people that have discovered My art and like it enough to purchase it. Thank you.\n\n2860x2860 pixel JPG\n\nMinted August 22nd, 2021.
