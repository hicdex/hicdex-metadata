They travel upon a boat as not to drown in possibly overwhelming experiences. This is a careful, tender, and mindful voyage without final destination.\n\nThe figure is opening their heart and allowing their inner essence to naturally pour out and nurture these forgotten aspects of themself. The flowers of their inner landscape, once wilted and grey, begin to blush with their natural colors. They are being restored through gentle love and care.\n\nThis piece is a reminder for us all to be aware of the neglected aspects of ourselves and to hold them with love. These pieces of us deserve care just as much as any others.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCS8usV6s1JynM5Ymf9PoV1SJKjXKVj1e21w2vMqqLth", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVhQMBc37FVYWVQSvPCvZs5VrztVbKJ7pZa4cheCGjTi3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCS8usV6s1JynM5Ymf9PoV1SJKjXKVj1e21w2vMqqLth", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XLUjvJKXHmp2djPmFe8MkrSoJx8sDL6U3"], "tags": ["universalhuman;trippy;collage;handmade;colorful"], "extra": {}}
