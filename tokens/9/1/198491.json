{"__version": 1, "token_id": 198491, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OBJKTs", "description": "This interactive OBJKT queries the hic et nunc contract on the Tezos blockchain to obtain the latest number of OBJKTs minted and will render the artwork with a series of bars representing each of the digits of that number. (Full vertical bar = 0)\n\nIt makes these queries without the use of 3rd-party web APIs (previously this was the only way to achieve this), technically making it a more resilient NFT. Instead, it communicates directly with Tezos RPC nodes using an embedded Taquito JS library, and is programmed to cycle through 5 of the currently most popular community-run nodes (Tezos Giga Node from Tezos Ukraine, SmartPy, Blockscale on behalf of the Tezos Foundation, ECAD Labs, Teznode from LetzBake!), should any one of them fail. \n\nThis OBJKT is a remint of OBJKT#185745 which was minted before communications with Tezos nodes were even whitelisted in hic et nunc's content security policy (CSP). Reminting turned out to be necessary as CSPs are applied at mint and do not work retroactively. Now this OBJKT is fully functional. The latest OBJKT count at time of repackaging this OBJKT, hence reflected in the static cover image, was 198451.\n\nClicking anywhere toggles between dark/light mode | Made in p5js | Created: 26 July 21 | Reminted: 9 August 2021 | Artist: @Yazid", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3pNAaui6196bzuTgaPnVQFcSzQrun7MCY1b8ZEBadu5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbunHHDw5ivy95eQhEmrtB1y1MMf8XdnJvoEHH24Ts5sx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQYzUhq8fcynyxJTpGTJgnSY5cGa2R7mWXEQuvfbZuDzC", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc3pNAaui6196bzuTgaPnVQFcSzQrun7MCY1b8ZEBadu5", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1QgjmhrUD3X7kgS9mMHbUz4cS6uDiFGhAU"], "tags": ["abstract", "generativeart", "interactive", "experimental", "tezos", "taquito", "p5js", "yazid"], "extra": {}}
