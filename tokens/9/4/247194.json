Hiding in the corner of her bed is a fancied notion, that foxhounette dog that pecks her head often when she passes through the gables; but it is better for her to dwell in the obscurity that is her breast, for if she could feel anything at all it is certain tha t she knows how to die.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUwBd7sFgCpB22gaCiqhWt49mrybhzjtCChP4PbUjsPm3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaRn8gPkEFNZArogk7zQuD62wDzopLF7uU7GdK2Fxfdpw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUwBd7sFgCpB22gaCiqhWt49mrybhzjtCChP4PbUjsPm3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bchTMEsYtQLZCaRc713M5feyfxzPD87TM"], "tags": ["alone", "neural", "animated", "painting", "expressionism"], "extra": {}}
