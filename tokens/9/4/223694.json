It promotes release of stagnant energy, and improves the electric circuit of our hue-man body. Clear fluid cycling of energy along the spine. The \"Sciatic Nerve\" is the focus of this exercise. It's the longest nerve in the body, running from the heel of the foot to the cranial nerve. Thats the sweet spot when making contact with the life-giving maternal force in our life...
