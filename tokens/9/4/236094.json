We were staying on Maui and took a whale tour between the islands. The large female surfaced quite near the boat and began rolling and waving her flipper in the air. I have been fascinated by humpback whales ever since and began painting them in 2013.\n\nThis painting shows the whale swimming in a forrest of kelp near my home on the Kent coast. There are no more whales here, though there is plenty of kelp and other sea life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcTVHB1VBBxRYHXFDmWZnTJSufPkE5qMZ8UcUYbkkCGc6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYBq56DmMkRGiYWcSgYNgB9rPTYyUdUNWZ4beWdgKvKkN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcTVHB1VBBxRYHXFDmWZnTJSufPkE5qMZ8UcUYbkkCGc6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Whale", "Humpback", "Kelp", "watercolor", "StephanieFuller"], "extra": {}}
