Through ArtOwly, these artists have switched on to a new platform exploring the world of NFTs.\n\nDynamic creatures that look like they hail from another world entail most of Mibin\u2019s works. Bright colours and anthropomorphic figures present themselves in his works though they seem distantly related to real creatures. Most of his creations and structures exist at the centre of the frame, balancing and floating in thin air. Though they are very far from being human, all of his figures have expressions of their own. They are thrilled and full of excitement and energy. All the elements of his artwork co-exist harmoniously, induced by a movement that seems to be controlling them. A shared rhythm creates a sense of ecstasy. These works seem to celebrate co-existence.\n\n\nMibin\u2019s art practice is dynamic with ephemeral emotions and thoughts. Though he\u2019s from Kerala, his locations are ever-changing, like his practice. He has completed his MFA in painting from Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan.\n\n\nWatercolour on rice paper /  6.5 x 7 inch\n\nN.B.
