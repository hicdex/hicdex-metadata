While many men desired her, only one equally pure as her could win her heart: a peasant boy by the name of Deaglan O'Cuiv. Her father however, was not pleased with the idea of his daughter Dolingen being with another peasant so he forbid them from being together.\n\nHaving heard of the tales of Dolingen's infinite beauty, a cruel Tyrant proposed her marrige. Tempted by the man's wealth, Dolingen's father eagerly accepted and soon after, Dolingen would adopt her new husband's surname: \"von Gratz\". The Tyrant however, soon began to torture his new wife in the most depraved of ways while holding her captive in one of the towers of Castle Artane.\n\nUnable to live with the pain of being caged and away from Deaglan, Dolingen eventually jumped from the Castle's tower and fell to her death. Feeling an immense guilt from not being able to save his beloved from the Tyrant, Deaglan came to her tomb and left a rose out of respect. Not long after, the bitter Tyrant also visited her tomb and, out of spite, grabed the rose and tore it appart, causing his hand to bleed. The Tyrant's blood reached Dolingen's corpse and after rejecting God for the indignities she suffered in life, she rose from her grave as one of the undead.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmejenygdDdvwVdJqN9uW3S3J4bYH7zwCoAgSHSVs2in1g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmt2hNJeovK4Ptp4dZXVC3Qx3GgkuD1cD2aguuGZg9uM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmejenygdDdvwVdJqN9uW3S3J4bYH7zwCoAgSHSVs2in1g", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Collage", "theartofmann", "vampire", "undead", "darkarts", "skull"], "extra": {}}
