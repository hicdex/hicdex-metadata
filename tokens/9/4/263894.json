The number 1800 came from the cut-up circle spinning 1800 degrees (360 x 5). \n\nThis design was inspired by shapes, cool colors, and my new love for gradient designs. For me, this piece has a nostalgia feel to it. The water like line placed in the center of the circle, represents summer water gun and water balloon fights in the 90s. \n\nDon\u2019t let you summer end, without a 1800 summertime spin!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeickba25ied24xvqmuj4dk3nnwae6374bsgxs7zhvojuwnkw5kd6sm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihfq3rlndjyr2jytdp2ashxfzy6cfaswtujhtj46hi766i66c6bgq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeickba25ied24xvqmuj4dk3nnwae6374bsgxs7zhvojuwnkw5kd6sm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1U5xSUaRugX1i1eF53EPzUESmPhVriBVZn"], "tags": ["summer", "blue", "purple", "colors", "video", "spinning"], "extra": {}}
