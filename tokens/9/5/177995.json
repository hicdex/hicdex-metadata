Our body is need of some serious anatomical and hormonal remodeling.\n\nSome examples:\nOur spines are a mess because we evolved from walking on all fours to two and our upright body posture puts excessive strain on our knees and hips. We have a morbid year-round interest in sex, perhaps we need an annual mating season. We could also use an extra heart and liver to pick up the slack on our modern diets and grow slender fingertips to minimize those pesky typos. Our tonsils and paranasal sinuses often get infected, but they also make our skulls lighter. If we were to remove them, our skulls would be much heavier and would need to develop stronger muscles in our necks to hold up our bulbous heads.\n\nThese are just a few examples of our physical imperfections and as you can see, we are far from a perfect design, in either form or function.\n\nBy @dehiscenceart 2021, 4200px X 6600 px\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNXNbjdZrtrHNFsQJSTBa1VqR3uTvKYk8kuB5FzAgmwSd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTv7uE2QRc23ANTuV6kYYZvDwoLueYTScXrsPY4ogSggv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNXNbjdZrtrHNFsQJSTBa1VqR3uTvKYk8kuB5FzAgmwSd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtZmtxhiWc8Nv6AtC1YjVCtJoFjv4nTqL"], "tags": ["surrealism", "tezos", "cleannfts", "anatomy", "nftcommunity", "nftcollectors", "artwithamessage", "collage", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
