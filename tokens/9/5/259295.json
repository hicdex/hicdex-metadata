But she knows she is a caprice-bearing figment thrown over the world in search of a home.\n\nShe knows she is loved, but she does not know it is by everyone. Shunned by the world, she turns around and smiles at the stranger. She knows you are there for her, she just does not care.\n\nIn her bliss, the pleasure center is clear, unfiltered by the world. She does not feel it, she does not care.
