The painting is huge and its landscape was done en plein air. It shows my daily walk in the hills overlooking downtown Los Angeles. At sunset the yellow mustard flower fields fluoresced, along the ridges of Winter's green hills. This is kind of a romantic painting compared to most of mine, which trend to the dark side.
