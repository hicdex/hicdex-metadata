This was shot in the spring of 2018, just before the bridge was torn down as part of a 35W/94 reconstruction project. This photo was also featured in the grand opening of the new iteration of the bridge that opened in August 2021, on display along the bridge's new fence, as part of MN-DOT's 'Bridge Fest.'
