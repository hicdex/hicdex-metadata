As far as they could enter the closed gates of their city, their existence is so far from human eyes. It was there that the rest of the city was built in my mind. Here I have reconstructed some of those fantasies.\n\nMUSIC:CUCUVOXELART\nSIZE:1500*1200", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd18AaAYypjA3ufZehWfJQRMWNcFCmLKJEaF2KJ5RVFkr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYN3wBxeeZN21jenc7raBJc8ZyEBE8VNcvSYaRNFznBdP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd18AaAYypjA3ufZehWfJQRMWNcFCmLKJEaF2KJ5RVFkr", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YEi9ZyTwtzE9utAn73rYCtBwFXoX34qEN"], "tags": ["forestobject4objekttreeparticleoctainecolorfuljungleanimationinteractivenftfluidleafpythonnftsarchitecturegreenhen200ktrippyp5jscryptoartinfectionsheedobjktcreativecodingpsychedelicnftartistmotionalgorithmicloopgenerativecleannfttouchdesignercolourfulglitchartvoxelcircleeyegasmgeometricprocessingabstractnoisecleannftsmimetype:video/mp4metadata//viewonipfs"], "extra": {}}
