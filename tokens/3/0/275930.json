All the pictures show women in the best versions of themselves. The woman, like the red color for me, conveys sexuality, beauty and power. And the crimson color goes hand in hand with the woman. Every job has its meaning, but I suggest you find something in common in each peace.\n\nSecond work is about discomfort. In the 21st century, girls still have to adjust to other people\u2019s boundaries. Often someone choose a \u00absquare\u00bb or a \u00abrectangle\u00bb for us. Women are forced to adjust to their living conditions while maintaining their self-confidence, beauty, womanhood and desire to develop. Now, this frame suggests that the model cannot be liberated, but her confident look and deep red color still make me fall in love with this photo.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiafuk5rv7xi5gph626l3vnqod4vap3bqelqaaokqavwnuxknuvppe", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidv4wkxgov3yl25nuoqoif2qmlxpsdaw7zlvdbesv6oapjapewwfy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiafuk5rv7xi5gph626l3vnqod4vap3bqelqaaokqavwnuxknuvppe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["redunion", "discomfort", "red"], "extra": {}}
