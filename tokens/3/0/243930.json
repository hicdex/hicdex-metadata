The Naga Sadhus are the followers of the Lord Shiva and they live in the Himalayas. The Kumbh Mela is the only time of the year during which they come down to the plains and it is therefore, an occasion of great significance to them. It is also the only time of the year when one can become a Naga Sadhu.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZLj3r3GBysMon6miFy6k8zdZLF1bwb2nAginGfzZ4Mz9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfBCPZq9UB3xSSPNTvnsYYBpXum5q46dFmfTSxkgyZF1i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZLj3r3GBysMon6miFy6k8zdZLF1bwb2nAginGfzZ4Mz9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cut7znhKDPCT72cAMufSXSbXfLb3zTq3w"], "tags": ["portrait", "nagasadhu", "kumbhmela", "India", "travel", "photography"], "extra": {}}
