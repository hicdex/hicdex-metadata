The woman in the painting is a forest elemental guardian, or Mother Nature if you will. You cannot discern her skin color or race because when it comes to nature we are all one, all equal. Her identity is unknown as at the core of life, it does not matter. The piece is created to display the beauty of the unknown. It feels familiar, yet foreign to us. This makes it both comforting and frightening. Nature feeds us and kills us. This is the balance of life.\n\nOriginal artwork by Sasha made for @nftadvisor.
