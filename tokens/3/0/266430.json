The Amazon River, located in South America, is the largest river in terms of water volume in the world and the second largest in terms of land area. With 6 568 km, it runs through the north of South America, the Amazon forest and flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It has more than a thousand tributaries, some of which, such as the Madeira, the Negro and the Japur\u00e1, are among the 10 largest rivers on the planet.\n\nIt is by far the river with the highest water flow per flow, with an average higher than that of the next seven largest rivers combined (excluding Madeira and Rio Negro, which are tributaries of the Amazon itself). The Amazon, which has the largest hydrographic basin in the world, with more than 7 million square kilometers, is responsible for about one-fifth of the total river flow in the world,[6][7] and the water that flows through Amazon rivers equivalent to 20% of the Earth's liquid fresh water.\n\nSince 2003, I've been creating images inspired by Brazilian rivers, especially those in the Amazon Basin.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiclqhqv7i43l7uevofrjnr2qfol364wz2jcaamso5oto5kc2ahfvq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiebus3qncms2nrm6mkplpxghpwovymef5n3opg5wpynoe62dv4exy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiclqhqv7i43l7uevofrjnr2qfol364wz2jcaamso5oto5kc2ahfvq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UYWVFQww89xSXyZzhNKAFeP4PM9Esc8TJ"], "tags": ["AMAZONAS", "AMAZON", "FLORESTAAMAZ\u00d4NICA", "AMAZONFOREST", "RIOAMAZONAS", "AMAZONRIVER", "NFT", "NFTARTIST", "DIGITALWORK", "GENERATIVEART", "COLORS", "3840X2160", "UHD", "EXCLUSIVE"], "extra": {}}
