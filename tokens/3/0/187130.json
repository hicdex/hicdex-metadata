As it ages, it becomes darker and resembles a pine cone rather than the mushroom and is quite resistant to decay, unlike other fungi in the Boletaceae family. It appears as pale with black woolly tufts dotted across the surface of the cap, like a cracked black and white dome.\n\nOld Man of the Woods is native to Europe and North America. Also found in Canada, Japan, Iran and Taiwan. Rarely found in the United Kingdom, and may preferentially grow in Northern Europe. This mushroom is edible, preferably harvested when young; although it may have little culinary value.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfGq8J6SKWSzvMq8NBCv1H3PZmpixs81Xba4zPAoC7d59", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfGq8J6SKWSzvMq8NBCv1H3PZmpixs81Xba4zPAoC7d59", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfGq8J6SKWSzvMq8NBCv1H3PZmpixs81Xba4zPAoC7d59", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
