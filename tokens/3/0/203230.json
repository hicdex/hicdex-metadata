Otherwise, sentiency is forever doomed.\u201d\n\n________________\n\nVisuals by drewmadestuff\nPoetry by Poetic Artificial Intelligence", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZBZqYYo7BDx6Sd2tdnfgWXgZgwuDyzAzML8anNZRWBMq", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbcn8YyAem7MZ3U4SV4dXVMwrULM8xY7jScmzFHvoJbFp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZBZqYYo7BDx6Sd2tdnfgWXgZgwuDyzAzML8anNZRWBMq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ddhNc3Uin5rjCzkN22S7NmahAfgLsWrhi"], "tags": ["abstract", "animated", "sci-fi", "gradients", "loop", "martian", "ancient", "futurism"], "extra": {}}
