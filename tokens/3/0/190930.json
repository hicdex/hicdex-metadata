When fear is in the way, we limit the ability for us to create our dreams and move forward with what we love most. To truly love something, you must push past the pain and grit of the grind that comes with making something you love come to life. The strength of that love can be quantified by your actions more than your words, however your words carry great power as well. Love is fierce and violent at times when threatened enough, so be sure to treat what you love considerately lest you be reminded of yourself. Heavy is the burden for those of us who walk as One knowing the path won't be easy, but always rewarding to those who survive the test, proving themselves as One.\n\nOwnership of this NFT gives you rights to make music, art and NFTs with this track so long as I'm credited in the work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPjMC5Z4VANUhZeuKNKtsg93o5FrSTBGiVU28xMs7Pwuw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQFqvHiNzH2JyxDRdNGssJ2waSeSokRwpKyjYpMTLc8io", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPjMC5Z4VANUhZeuKNKtsg93o5FrSTBGiVU28xMs7Pwuw", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dS3h1X7GgMB98xypepPsmSRJ2xozxFEqS"], "tags": ["Instrumental", "Rap", "Trap", "Hip-Hop", "R&B", "NFTTrap"], "extra": {}}
