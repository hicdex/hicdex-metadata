Earth's moon is the fifth largest in the Solar System and is larger than any known dwarf planet. Isotope dating of lunar samples suggest the moon was formed 50 million years after the formation of the Solar System. The prevailing theory in the formation of the moon is that an ancient planet the size of Mars, Theia, crashed into the proto-Earth launching debris into the atmosphere creating the moon Luna.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8AyZoiB43QnJLSiBHivqng6PVN8WzvBg7PGQeg1c916", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZBhqbE9xwv4st2oPU6QNMvGEw88RgP9Unx9woesd7Y1k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb8AyZoiB43QnJLSiBHivqng6PVN8WzvBg7PGQeg1c916", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bFrPEsTCiaLVcJBTc6QpGfixCwVpVPwE2"], "tags": ["space", "galaxy", "milkyway", "star", "solarsystem", "moon", "luna", "pocketplanets"], "extra": {}}
