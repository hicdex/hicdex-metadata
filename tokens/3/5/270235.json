We need to overcome generational trauma, to stop the chain of inherited conflict. We need to stop projecting our frustrations on the following generations, we need to stop and simplify, find calmness and peace, search for the emptiness, become nothing. Less not more.\n\nOnce I was told that both the pessimist and the optimist know and understand that many things are wrong, the difference is that the pessimist thinks that nothing can be done and because of this belief, does nothing. And the optimist thinks that something can be done to change the situation, and fights for that change.\n\nI am an optimist that thinks that through love, kindness, empathy, softness, community and creativity, the necessary change towards a more peaceful and respectful humanity is possible. And all I do is work for that. \ud83d\udc9a\n\nFractal from original photography.
