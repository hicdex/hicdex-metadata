We might feel oneness with the universe. We might understand things that perplexed us in our normal lives. This is the space of revelation. This is the calm connection to everything. This is UNITY.\n\nSixth in a series of six. You can only receive this piece by collecting GOOD TRIP, the first in the series. You will also receive the other four images for free. Plus, one collector will be randomly selected to be gifted a 1/1 edition of the frozen blood macro photography shot that was the sole input for all the images in this series.\n\n2238x3968 JPG\n\nMinted July 24th, 2021.
