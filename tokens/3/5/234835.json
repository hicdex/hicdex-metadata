You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change\u201d \u2015 Thich Nhat Hanh", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmThYRcfnkLcgvsaKFfwr8eY4qacdRKmUATaxFwe1kEo2q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTRFq7wcBwR9orf2KPPR1cHGeo6Aa4PGXy6S7vk7GVF8r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmThYRcfnkLcgvsaKFfwr8eY4qacdRKmUATaxFwe1kEo2q", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YU6VHV4mohhLiw8Su5NMf4CdqLHFNZeFx"], "tags": ["illustration"], "extra": {}}
