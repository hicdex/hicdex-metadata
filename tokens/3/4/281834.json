Weekuri Lagoon is located about 60 kilometers from the district capital, Tambolaka. \n\nThe name Weekuri comes from the Sumba language wee which means water and kuri which means grated or splash. Weekuri Lagoon is believed to have been formed from sea water splashed through the reef so that it penetrated into the mainland. This lake is surrounded by rocks that separate it from the sea. Local myth says that Weekuri is said to have been the name of a village that sank due to overflowing sea water.\n\nLake Weekuri is oval in shape with a length of about 150 meters and a furthest width of 50 meters. The depth of the lake ranges from 30 cm to 2.5 meters at low tide but can reach five meters at high tide.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifjfsrxtzel45llzfzjna5ehm46fk47wqkertprxb6p3e56awuj5a", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib4xc2lxso5xigwq2ttc7jzhwg5ndqywdzg4d5licbmbvuopt7dcq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifjfsrxtzel45llzfzjna5ehm46fk47wqkertprxb6p3e56awuj5a", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["Aerial", "view", "landscape", "nature", "exploreweekurilagoon", "Sumbaisland", "Indonesia"], "extra": {}}
