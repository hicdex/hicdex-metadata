{"__version": 1, "token_id": 258434, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "5", "description": "A new and revolutionary emphasis on the tabula rasa occurred late in the 17th century, when the English empiricist John Locke, in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), argued for the mind\u2019s initial resemblance to \u201cwhite paper, void of all characters,\u201d with \u201call the materials of reason and knowledge\u201d derived from experience. Locke did not believe, however, that the mind is literally blank or empty prior to experience, and almost no other empiricist has taken such an extreme position. Locke himself acknowledged an innate power of \u201creflection\u201d (awareness of one\u2019s own ideas, sensations, emotions, and so on) as a means of exploiting the materials given by experience as well as a limited realm of a priori (nonexperiential) knowledge, which he nevertheless regarded as \u201ctrifling\u201d and essentially empty of content (e.g., \u201csoul is soul\u201d and \u201cevery man is an animal\u201d).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmefXLyoonqmbTXuUCV6trxGqYsvA11AyLrKxNz4zVygp9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQHJdoaGkHuodGVJFwaXBninYShPnYtW2VYg1ZF32JBDG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmefXLyoonqmbTXuUCV6trxGqYsvA11AyLrKxNz4zVygp9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Tzy4MkerHBjs47YCarWfwhTV8RpDbukdg"], "tags": ["NFTPhotography", "NFTArt", "NFTArtist", "Tezos", "TezosArt", "Tabularasa", "soul", "eyes", "portraits", "hicetnunc", "psychedelicart"], "extra": {}}
