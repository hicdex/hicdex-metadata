His hands were broken sometime later but I'd like to believe he was so deep into his meditation that he didn't even notice they were gone. He was glitched out in early 2021 by the artist named 8oh8z, so he's kind of been through a lot.\n\nThis original GlitchArt project is based on a sculpture currently on view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 208, and online at the following link:\n\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/42163", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX1y4zypgxZNWcVCvTHjqKxYwoVAqD1LTfESARRM5sPC3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNsssCu1vDq39SbfqMDpnNoB34ewjWK7NT51CaJNo3tJ3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX1y4zypgxZNWcVCvTHjqKxYwoVAqD1LTfESARRM5sPC3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ijWdQVMxQci4zvaJ13ztxbkFNLm3hZScu"], "tags": ["GlitchArt", "Glitch", "Colors", "Psychedelic", "Trippy", "Colorful", "Meditation", "PsychedelicArt"], "extra": {}}
