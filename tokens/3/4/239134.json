Only 50 pieces of this specific BOX Dude will be given away on HEN and the other 50 put up for sale.\n\nPS: BOX Dude is just as cool as Zenshy, he's just kinda mad at the moment", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme6vW4W75kNNSsFwyzRdajqAQ3jbDDjPMxomVPj79tntJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme6vW4W75kNNSsFwyzRdajqAQ3jbDDjPMxomVPj79tntJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme6vW4W75kNNSsFwyzRdajqAQ3jbDDjPMxomVPj79tntJ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ejH12nPiKqyZntesui1DJLevR5sYA4fTk"], "tags": ["BOXDude", "ZENSHY", "Zen", "Grunge", "ART"], "extra": {}}
