{"__version": 1, "token_id": 248034, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Northern Pintail (F)", "description": "Pixel art of a female Anas acuta (Northern Pintail).\n\nThe pintail or northern pintail (Anas acuta) is a duck with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe and across the Palearctic and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton's pintail is considered to be a separate species.\n\nThis is a large duck, and the male's long central tail feathers give rise to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.\n\nThe northern pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, owing to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaCY58VmvmYeWE22qGTZVnXAVzpxjU9jeb3JWAFsfaMUB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaCY58VmvmYeWE22qGTZVnXAVzpxjU9jeb3JWAFsfaMUB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaCY58VmvmYeWE22qGTZVnXAVzpxjU9jeb3JWAFsfaMUB", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UDG8mPpChGueJykoEmQrgV78boDe4ANkd"], "tags": ["pixel", "duck", "wildlife"], "extra": {}}
