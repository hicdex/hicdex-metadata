Do they possess a skeleton, muscular system and a skin? Are they able to see, hear and touch? Do they breathe? \n\nNo one can speculate anything close to what could be out there since out there is itself an unknown. That's how bizarre and unfamiliar our imagination is about anything outside of our current experience.\n\nDigital Painting\n2048x2048 Pixels\n\n2016", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbbZVvxzVW7M6kqpxCJ5zJGvpU8vDKBhwDC4vEGf2NJ6d", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma1JKXFNNox6dbuBhJhxhV7HsKeAZ79wdcdHSJ9d81P1V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbbZVvxzVW7M6kqpxCJ5zJGvpU8vDKBhwDC4vEGf2NJ6d", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PHMUCabijLqw3F5FE9LmqdRXRrAWPt2VP"], "tags": ["digitalpainting", "alien", "void", "intelligentbeing", "beings", "abstract", "expressionism", "contemporary", "pink", "red", "yellow", "tentacles", "life", "extraterrestrial"], "extra": {}}
