Basoeki Abdullah is a prominent mooi indie artist after Raden Saleh era in Indonesia, which expose beauty of nature and woman.\n\nIn this photo, I reverse the image depicted by Basuki. I chose to photograph four men freely swimming in a rural river. Then stack it with the image of a modern space: doors, windows, motors. In addition, in the right corner there is a female figure that was accidentally photographed. I'm wondering what would it be when we are get used of malegaze, how would it be with femalegaze?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWNzQXvEmbDNqJAHPSgWa4unEQRYq5X7eK43A9Y6BSgJE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNe1MSzzWcEDSDXbYBx8BBakpJqLMUn3WVB2H8pUzpx2W", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWNzQXvEmbDNqJAHPSgWa4unEQRYq5X7eK43A9Y6BSgJE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e2hFsn6xwF3ePqbMViTgLgLipGNxSdz93"], "tags": ["photograph", "35mm", "doubleexposure"], "extra": {}}
