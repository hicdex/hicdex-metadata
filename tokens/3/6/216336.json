Our limited sense of time makes this difficult to see, however. With AI-Animation we gain the ability to render the process of change visible and possible to experience.\n\nThese AI-Landscapes have been imagined by the IceGAN-neural network that was trained with my photographs from various endeavors to Greenland and Iceland where I captured thousands of images of glaciers and icebergs in different shapes and sizes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWsrz6D6bHVpBUgw2u2H7pYN4Br2Ate73WQss5bveFp3i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTsjSGZh5hYGBvP9HdwnJuVMWjZPA8jD5GpnBbaHe61L5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWsrz6D6bHVpBUgw2u2H7pYN4Br2Ate73WQss5bveFp3i", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XA2fz7qbBgP7bYELn3VA5Kud1816vUYVE"], "tags": ["ice", "greenland", "ai", "gan", "stylegan", "generative", "generativeart", "nature", "landscape", "greenland", "water", "ocean", "arctic"], "extra": {}}
