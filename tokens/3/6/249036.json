Places she can escape to, knowing that's where her soul belongs. Yet she feels a sense of heartache, that she can't stop thinking about these worlds, wishing she is in them: \"Will I ever get to live like this?\" Her own reality deems her mysterious diagnosis crazy, that her world is not enough and pales in comparison to the ones in her dreams. She is tired of being told to remain in this \"reality\", when the world she lives in screams: \"Leave.\" The yearning for a life filled with excitement and happiness, even magic. And at night, she has to pretend about the worlds in her head, or else she can't fall asleep. She is often misunderstood, because for her, magic is everything, for she, herself, is magic.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQgwaFVmi5z3F7a9fnkzaQoBiJCwN1KbCdeWWjePCBDU1", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmax5x8AVWx14E5xaPrhiffUKq9J8dmzeEpZKZaY2bdQZE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQgwaFVmi5z3F7a9fnkzaQoBiJCwN1KbCdeWWjePCBDU1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rw2JoU2AK2TNdfhcd4h918CdTGSNh5Gnw"], "tags": ["hiraeth", "spilledink"], "extra": {}}
