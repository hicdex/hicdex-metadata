Now I\u2019m finally happy with it. \n\nBalance, of colour, form and detail is what I\u2019m after. I want the eye to be lead around it, resting on a particular feature or shade or finding interest in another section. \n\nI\u2019ve got this theory, having been really rubbish at mediation for years that simple beauty helps calm the mind. Obviously beauty is different for everyone but these artworks are my attempt at adding something beautiful to our environment. \n\nThey\u2019re hand drawn digital artworks, for want of better words. I\u2019m not particularly technically minded. I use the ubiquitous technology lying around us all, the same way a folk artist may use bits of wood lying around in the back yard to express herself. \n\nI think the circle lends itself to abstracts really well. It seems to become an object, rather than a \u2018grab\u2019 of some endless pattern. You\u2019re not missing something with the circle. You can relax. The work becomes framed and self-contained, yet I\u2019ve found that using colour around the circle unites the whole picture plain. \n\nI started using the circle when making a collection called Japa, based on meditation or prayer beads. I\u2019ve come to see that working within set parameters is a great way to concentrate the mind and bring a sense of cohesion to what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m fascinated by the idea of a common thread running through everything and every body. \n\nThere\u2019s a real sense of relief when one decides to stay here, knowing that you\u2019ve found something important. I could be trying this, then that but I\u2019ve decided to stay and enjoy the way I make art in the hope that this sense of contentment is passed on to you, the owner. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTtrKDEpTeaNqc9cFT3fxxRKz9EorJqwzc2nR4QxTXaFz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTi9Xb3279r2msW3GkrE3MMuD2RPZvqT5W1wCM4YgPi8T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTtrKDEpTeaNqc9cFT3fxxRKz9EorJqwzc2nR4QxTXaFz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NHP2mmBNbagWLLnaKM3C1QCtmuk2Qjg26"], "tags": ["abstract", "labelsonhumans", "selftaught", "fineart", "beauty", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
