In my dream I saw a station-terminal-like place where we could meet and give hugs to our loved ones who had already died. The station was up there in the sky. I have to look up, and climb a ladder to get to it. But sadly, we cannot stay in that station for long. We can only share hugs, smile, and then they must go again\nriding the cloud. This dream of mine is sweet and indeed very foggy, I can see the laughter of every family who reunites, happy tears, and sweet smiles.
