It is a statement on generative variants that can be easily created by changing a few variables in generative art. Being a generative artist myself I felt that I should find out what would it take to create large number of variants \u201cde-generatively\u201d.

Each of the 45 autos is an automatic drawing and hence carries a portion or a signature of my subconscious.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf9PXEMoH3JZkrtAGqD84uD2WsnZbkXWGXVad3LGdoyUM", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme6PQ1aYyH2GhrpsTzu2FAAF2X9d8SjmUWGEaK7gcjmKs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf9PXEMoH3JZkrtAGqD84uD2WsnZbkXWGXVad3LGdoyUM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fAydZDUfXTNWLwTgG4RaRvYenkKyVsqnG"], "tags": ["illustration", "generative", "degenrative"], "extra": {}}
