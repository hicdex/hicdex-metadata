No sense worrying; tomorrow's already been written. Of course, successful people don\u2019t always have time to pore through Dick, Delany, LeGuin, and Butler just to glean some useful predictions for the future. \n\nFutureAbstract is the most efficient way to absorb science fiction's key tomorrows: a series of four study guides for the future, delivered to your desktop as insightful PDF summaries that can be digested in less than 10 minutes. Each guide includes an essay, case study, reading list and study questions. \n\nFutureAbstract was commissioned for the Walker Art Museum's \"Intangibles\" gift shop in 2015 and remastered in 2021 with updated reading lists. FutureAbstract/Future Unmanned explores the feminist science fiction of the 1970s and its vision of matriarchal society.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiavmx65xft47vyoes7ybshpfevsz7bcatmkvkovmpsd2h7yp35fxy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiaozy4jkgvvdvmcvo27p26mfxfbx6k25bwejfrmoo53hohaacfqca", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiavmx65xft47vyoes7ybshpfevsz7bcatmkvkovmpsd2h7yp35fxy", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1Twr34WWca5TYLNBchyw4RXqGcRRSyWw7n"], "tags": ["futureabstract", "clairelevans", "sciencefiction", "pdf"], "extra": {}}
