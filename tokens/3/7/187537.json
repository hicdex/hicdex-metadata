I have been fortunate to inherit it from my great uncle. Professional Photographer (1901-1991). The collection though was stored for approximately 40 years in a very dumb environment. As a result that all glass plate negatives have been affected by humidity. You can find out more about the collection on my website https://www.sergisadamos.com/about-metamorphosis-art-exhibition-2019 \nWhen I started scanning the collection I was amazed at the images that were revealed. As an artist, digital artist, discovering such work, in its unique condition, I felt blessed and from then I could not stop wondering how to interact with this new material.\nThe specific image presented to you here is part of my experiments that have been going on since I first discovered them. You can see three local Greek Orthodox priests, early 20th century, posing for an annual picture. \nI combined the deteriorated patterns, caused by humidity, with the priests, by adding colors, allowing to unite the whole composition together, seeking to be evaluated in a new contemporary context.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUjuxmkYAbkP1zqEPqdRT6JQp41sdnzYuyWteJsjJyMyK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVtDQM4HufEKPC3wXjsEDRqduciourxePvDPWgzTuxGZ6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUjuxmkYAbkP1zqEPqdRT6JQp41sdnzYuyWteJsjJyMyK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PgWWgnc7piiRKtWMSsoyZLoKf7GewjmzQ"], "tags": ["oldphotos", "orthodoxpriests", "contemporarymixedmediaart", ""], "extra": {}}
