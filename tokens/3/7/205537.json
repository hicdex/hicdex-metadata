At the edge of the Artist\u2019s understanding is the vast unknown, the place where the next expression is coming from. When it comes, even the Artist is surprised by the new expression. The Art arts itself and the Artist is coming along for the ride just like everybody else. /// I think this is what the Artist is specifically wired to share to the society. To show others how to cultivate this state of creation, not from some logical source, but somewhere more intuitive and felt in the gut. To cultivate a state where there is trust in the movement as it comes, with no (intellectual) worry for what comes after. /// It doesn\u2019t only come through via grandiose masterworks. It can come in something as simple as a single idea you weren\u2019t able to perceive before. /// Where/what is the source of this expression? We\u2019ve called it different things in different languages to different peoples. Sometimes the words suffice, but in the case of art, sometimes the entirety piece itself is what\u2019s needed to successfully communicate this experience.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSinuppv1N8LgY2YNDVtVzEtKyAZfT4KncYsrq8uqnGUz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaLE4m7CNoafrHQhqkKWAUxEjqpTHE2AMRzT8DHneHyHU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSinuppv1N8LgY2YNDVtVzEtKyAZfT4KncYsrq8uqnGUz", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1LBayeDsbbgDu7euVnKB8WywgNGkemvZiV"], "tags": ["calligraphy", "handwriting", "lettering", "penmanship", "text", "zen", "meditation", "graphic", "design", "minimalist", "iphone", "flow", "graffiti", "cyberzen"], "extra": {}}
