The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmczyKCJLF4ex9XjuPJYhwFNZpT2cGGciMXM6cRMynL6Yf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmczyKCJLF4ex9XjuPJYhwFNZpT2cGGciMXM6cRMynL6Yf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmczyKCJLF4ex9XjuPJYhwFNZpT2cGGciMXM6cRMynL6Yf", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"], "tags": ["CCA", "90"], "extra": {}}
