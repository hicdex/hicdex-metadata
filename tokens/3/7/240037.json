This process is repeated until the bounding box prevents any more lines being drawn.\n\nThis set is my first digital attempt, drawn in a moving vehicle for extra error.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQUTZjPvYMkLn7fjoRKBsidTgWZiXE8eDYgdPav7Dxejg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWf3bSLFbFU9cBGUKAP9QSJR7MxGchLLkLc7yqBDxK2kZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQUTZjPvYMkLn7fjoRKBsidTgWZiXE8eDYgdPav7Dxejg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "digitaldrawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
