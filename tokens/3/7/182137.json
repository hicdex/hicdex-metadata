{"__version": 1, "token_id": 182137, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Netherworld", "description": "In religion and folklore, hell is an afterlife location in which evil souls are subjected to punitive suffering, often torture, as eternal punishment after death. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations, the biggest examples of which are Christianity and Islam, whereas religions with reincarnation usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations, as is the case in the dharmic religions. Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under Earth's surface. Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Paradise, Purgatory, Limbo, and the underworld.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeZ6fWjwUyAKoerPvUJQx5HWSEjBGzBeepaTTEPHAcPnq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWtJa3xKWxbSTEtejAekRfPp3zAnArr1XNuwVGp1ZDxv7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeZ6fWjwUyAKoerPvUJQx5HWSEjBGzBeepaTTEPHAcPnq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bkijFBq4h4dmVa9TBANpaAABXti7zPY2v"], "tags": ["Hell", "c4d", "rendering", "3d", "god", "mythology", "greek"], "extra": {}}
