{"__version": 1, "token_id": 194838, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Fountain of Love", "description": "This painting is about the passion of love. An allegory of the nature and progress of love, the painting has its origins in the poetry of classical antiquity.\n\nImbued with the thrilling rush of those first beguiling moments of love the fountain gurgles and crackles into the water below. The stream flows and becomes calm... Eventually it climbs back up and rejuvenates the fountain at the top and the passion begins again. In youth and age forever together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTaL8qdU8WLxRRisKRcQ8rGbTUkMcZSJN8wG2Fv3yZcDG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVfEFWq1rcmgrDjJBZ27JKeGCs83AbjBoCoLeX4EXx9ei", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTaL8qdU8WLxRRisKRcQ8rGbTUkMcZSJN8wG2Fv3yZcDG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Fountain", "StephanieFuller", "Watercolor", "Love", "Painting"], "extra": {}}
