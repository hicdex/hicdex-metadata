I met Mrs. Reggie while she was sitting at a restaurant at the bottom of her building with some friends. She was drinking a bit and seemed flattered when I asked her to write for me and allow me to take her photo. We took 2 photos and then she went back to her table to write in my book. After writing, she gave me a hug and thanked me.\nWe talked for a bit longer after the photos and this is when she explained to me that in her pastime she makes youtube videos. When I asked her what kind of content she posted, she laughed and told me that she uploads reactions to reaction videos. She told me to look her up under \"Head Hippie H Town\" and sure enough there were videos with her reacting to others reacting to things.
