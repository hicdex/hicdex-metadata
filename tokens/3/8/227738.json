Thousands upon thousands of families from different backgrounds all coming together in a shared experience. You learn to co-exist and find common ground, especially during uncommon times.

You might not see anyone in this picture, but there they are, always on call during times of need.\n\n3480x2160 JPEG\n\nPhoto by Jason Charnick\nTaken in the Bronx, NY, USA", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVuZcF2EmzU3LfjKrtVjBmeRHwbHYiMP4YykMaYpUCgdR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfGUtGswn4yaJF2QzH91omDhXMWzfLWmLCMRLuGysVSYL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVuZcF2EmzU3LfjKrtVjBmeRHwbHYiMP4YykMaYpUCgdR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cBiEqnbzUkXvB79yhntnemWt8TzG7Qxdy"], "tags": ["TheAbsenceIsAlwaysPresent", "GenerativityvsStagnation", "Photo", "Photography", "NiftyFilm", "NewYorkCity", "NYC", "Bronx", "B&W", "#SupportIndieFilm"], "extra": {}}
