When we really take a closer look at the feelings like happiness, joy, contentedness, and feeling connected, one of those emotions cannot be created without a dose of gratitude. \n\nGratitude or being grateful involves enjoying the state of life by practicing appreciation. It means appreciating everything we experience in everything we do. \n\nLet`s set the intention to develop our ability to access gratitude and let that appreciation and peace expand into even the most frustrating of situations. \n\nTake a deep breath in and breath out slowly. Bring to mind one thing that you are truly grateful for right now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQgcH2snLpNdPZG8BSS7gic2gX82QkntQWaYNabuMoqCy", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmceau34RYoyr9yET8ZseGt8TsCtCUfD8Kr1W7W2JXxwnt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQgcH2snLpNdPZG8BSS7gic2gX82QkntQWaYNabuMoqCy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Qo6mXMimYYzQRu5xv65pLct7Lk8S84pm2"], "tags": ["quuxuum89", "gratitude", "kaleidoscopic", "meditative", "mindfulness", "experimental", "hen200k"], "extra": {}}
