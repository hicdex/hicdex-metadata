However that obsession prevents us from enjoying and appreciating the skin that we, as real people, live within. Our skins witness and record our lives in a myriad of ways, some through our own choices, some resulting from medical interventions but mostly from the abrasion of engaging with life as we progress through it.\n\nWe are a diverse group of people, who have lived a bit, have been through good times and the occasional pandemic, and who because of, or in spite of that, are still kicking ass in our own way. \n\nHere each of us comes forward, and presents our skin for others to inspect, peruse and read, and perhaps connect to the many indelible marks of their lives on their own skins.\n\nThis is my second work.
