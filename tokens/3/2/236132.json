During our conversation I learnt more about the calf and Kynan.\n\u201cHi! Love your work!\nIt\u2019d be great if you\u2019d like to paint Yirili using my photo!...I am a sailor and a pilot and if this pic can raise awareness for doing something about helping the ocean it would be absolutely amazing!\u201d Kynan Wall\n\nStrangely I painted Yirili with Migaloo 8 years ago in this and a few other paintings. Before Yirili was born! As yet I haven't finished a painting based on Kynan's photograph, but I will.\n\nYirilli may not be Migaloo's progeny but it's fun to imagine he is...\n\nFor me Migaloo has become a symbol for all living creatures and the fragility of the environment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcoiDmvoBQx5P79QKY9on1n7TdNB5QvdmaFTTPTsPEHH5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVPgchGNXPzYXCmo3PkGojQ6A4djyULwHA2rsHStxeGj4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcoiDmvoBQx5P79QKY9on1n7TdNB5QvdmaFTTPTsPEHH5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["whale", "Migaloo", "Yirilli", "whitewhale", "humpback", "OilPainting", "StephanieFuller"], "extra": {}}
