It started as an idea on why NFTs are non changeable. They are of course non fungible but now you can be the decision maker and make it your own.\n\nThe algorithm is based on the phyllotaxis (the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem (from Ancient Greek ph\u00fdllon \"leaf\" and t\u00e1xis \"arrangement\") algorithm and has evolved into an animation of growing and shrinking. \n\nJust as a flower would fold out its petals so much that it explodes. Then the time is reversed.
