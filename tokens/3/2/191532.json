It is nothing to drink from, and, because of its closeness, it is not very suitable for keeping fruit. Even though one could use it for arranging flowers, like almost every vessel, one would not immediately take it for a vase. Seemingly it is a vessel without any determinate purpose, just a vessel that is just what it is.Though it cannot be recognized as functional, it can be described in its particular shape and material quality. Thus one would discover its perceivable appearance as a character of things prior to all functionality.\u201d\n\u2013 G\u00fcnter Figal\n\nG\u00fcnter Figal is professor of philosophy at University of Freiburg (Germany).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY7RHdAmVNbJGvSaCWzQZXNnoDNBbHDNH6StNHkHHkg4Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY5z29XgXZnJiKMZZvmfMDc9JZ5NWe5XVw6MAbfNLTHrp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY7RHdAmVNbJGvSaCWzQZXNnoDNBbHDNH6StNHkHHkg4Z", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NisvvqYZE1dgsJTY14XL64xbsNudSAgTS"], "tags": ["Vessel", "GuenterFigal", "KunstvereininHamburg", "SimonDenny", "ProofofStake"], "extra": {}}
