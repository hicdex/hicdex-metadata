{"__version": 1, "token_id": 268132, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "\ud83c\udf33 a tree floating in precision", "description": "a tree floating in precision is part of a series of studies which confront the compromise between precision and representation as experienced in digital systems which use floating point number formats.\n\nThis project exploits the fact that floating point numeric systems cannot represent all real numbers. This can be seen in most digital 3d systems when geometry is modelled or moved very far away from the origin of the 3d scene. This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem.\n\nThe tree was chosen to study how the errors would affect bifurcating and organic objects. Audio from forests and wind chimes were chosen to accompany the animation and parts of the audio were subjected to the same far from origin manipulation as the 3d model. As they move farther from their origin, they can no longer be represented as continuous elements of shape and sound. The digital formats designed to represent them break down. \n\n1920 x 1080 (16:9), 30fps, 1200 frames, 00:00:40\n\n3d model credits:\n\"Tree\" (https://skfb.ly/onxWu) by Epic_Tree_Store is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n\u00a9 2021 Luis E.
