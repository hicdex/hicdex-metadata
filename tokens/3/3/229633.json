Ahura Mazda, the great Zoroaster deity is now responsible for burning remaining NFT batches. \n\nZarathustra the main prophet of this religion also seems to have inspired 19th century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in the writings of his book, \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". Coupling this book with his theory of the eternal return, we are allowed to wonder if he was implying that ending up to the founding the first in a new series of cults was an inevitable recurrence? We'll never know, unless perhaps we are someday able to effectively emulate Mr. Nietzsche's synapses structure trough artificial means. Which I doubt we'll ever be able to do, unless we understand how to harvest neurologic data from the past trough unforeseen quantum means? Who knows?\n\n[01-12-20]\ncreated with trapcode Form and Particular OG gif 1:1 | 640x640 posted on giphy\non this day has gathered 1 129 623 views\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/zarathustra-zoroastrianism-zoroaster-JmzEjmncYa3KBH7SDv\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZG22RyuazKgU2kJv7WqshxCHyD1BW1uVcnAvEVLJgZsV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZG22RyuazKgU2kJv7WqshxCHyD1BW1uVcnAvEVLJgZsV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZG22RyuazKgU2kJv7WqshxCHyD1BW1uVcnAvEVLJgZsV", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["zoroaster", "zarathustra", "zoroastrianism", "fire", "burning", "deity", "religion", "philosophy", "AhuraMazda", "Nietzsche"], "extra": {}}
