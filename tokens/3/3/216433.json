Our limited sense of time makes this difficult to see, however. With AI-Animation we gain the ability to render the process of change visible and possible to experience.\n\nThese AI-Landscapes have been imagined by the IceGAN-neural network that was trained with my photographs from various endeavors to Greenland and Iceland where I captured thousands of images of glaciers and icebergs in different shapes and sizes.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeWeYPhT99YPhNFLCpEbjtw1ii8DDj3DvKJxFAPRkDTxk", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma6itJKmJ2ExFcFD6PziQHKK8iEhv6aAeUPmDREXpTm7D", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeWeYPhT99YPhNFLCpEbjtw1ii8DDj3DvKJxFAPRkDTxk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XA2fz7qbBgP7bYELn3VA5Kud1816vUYVE"], "tags": ["ice", "iceberg", "gan", "ai", "generative", "generativeart", "landscape", "winter", "nature", "greenland"], "extra": {}}
