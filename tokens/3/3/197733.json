They organize content at the same time as they are entangled with issues of information hierarchies, categorical equivalences, inclusions and exclusions to name only a few. With the basic understanding that there is nothing inevitable about the design of our technologies \u2013 that the decisions made in the design and management of objects like filters are not in themselves neutral acts but are bound to societal values and wider socio-cultural and economic systems - we aim to reveal how dangerous some of these decisions have been and how they provide material answers to how to live and act in the world.\u201d\n\u2013 Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Gillian Russell\n\nWendy Hui Kyong Chun is the Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, where she leads the Digital Democracies Institute. \n\nGillian Russell is a designer, researcher, and curator. Her projects investigate how contemporary design practice can be used as a medium to engage with and question the political dimension of technology\u2019s influence on social life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7Qy5vyD4zopQynbwHMWjSj5YuquDN7m68i6hqYxRKom", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc6cs5wUaXKfyPreGrTVKtorKzZHqErds3w1GjMEtoYFZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd7Qy5vyD4zopQynbwHMWjSj5YuquDN7m68i6hqYxRKom", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NisvvqYZE1dgsJTY14XL64xbsNudSAgTS"], "tags": ["Filter", "WendyHuiKyongChun", "GillianRussell", "KunstvereininHamburg", "SimonDenny", "ProofofStake"], "extra": {}}
