DELLEN has one of the most important jobs when it comes to NFTs. She loves words and likes to create secret combination of words to help people protect their wallets. When you ask her for a seed phrase she gets really excited and multiplies into many versions of herself, each trying to find a special word and then lines them all up together. Be careful though as she forgets the combination of words straight away so you need to write down the words and keep them safe.
