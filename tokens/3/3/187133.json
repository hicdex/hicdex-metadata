Every single object, natural or man-made, is potentially imbued with a spirit, a god. In this kind of world, you are definitely predisposed to act more carefully and respectfully to your environment. Not to impose yourself on it, but to touch the Earth lightly and to treat everything with great care. This is the world of Shinto and Japan.\n\n'Shinto' is the original religion of the Japanese. According to it, there is 'kami' or 'gods' in every living and inanimate thing alike.\n\nThis series portrays Shinto shrines in urban and nature settings in the moments of ephemeral afternoon light.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmduEwZxC2nia91Y89gcEzkhqqRbJPv3xSfZd9qZV4hsas", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdecwtLvbLNPWNzGavYZrKHRiRyTHb6C5NsGdcrkLrFPC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmduEwZxC2nia91Y89gcEzkhqqRbJPv3xSfZd9qZV4hsas", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hwMnECCjLRFknUJNBHg11FpAbYSbKSqph"], "tags": ["illustration", "art", "digitalart", "shinto", "shintoshrine", "shintoarchitecture", "Japan", "KashimaJingu"], "extra": {}}
