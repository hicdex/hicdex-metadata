By applying modeling or 3D scanning technique, physical objects become digital data that algorithms can play out, thus making the image and sound share the same source. When one element is converted, everything changes. With a reverse oscilloscope, the geometrical coordinate data of the 3D object are transformed into sound waveforms. The vibrations through media are thus heard and seen as they surround viewers.\n\n1080*1080 60FPS MP4, Stereo Sound, 30s, Seamless Loop;\nMade with TouchDesigner", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPsEQPysTuz4hCXuJFB1yQz9554m6U3Y38cG8osetTgBC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWGJJSZZin4VUBfEFwc3CCXSan4iLXLccvA86myGYxLcL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPsEQPysTuz4hCXuJFB1yQz9554m6U3Y38cG8osetTgBC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ePy7JPbV7jaw57rKavh3mCdteUazLUEMG"], "tags": ["Flower", "AudioVisual", "PixelSorting", "Imagery_Resonance", "TouchDesigner", "craftWeak", "Particles"], "extra": {}}
