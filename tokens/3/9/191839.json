From the famous sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarotti, which depicts Jesus dead in his mother's arms, the theme is revisited in this work to represent stories of crime and violence, specially when resulting from social inequality. The work features a phrase in French that means \"This is not justice\". It is inspired by Ren\u00e9 Magritte's famous masterpiece 'La trahison des images' (The Treachery of Images - This is Not a Pipe, 1929).
