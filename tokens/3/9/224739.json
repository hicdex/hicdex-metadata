All previously agreed natural laws in the material world are broken; There is no gravity, the construction elements can be whatever you want, in the shape, size and color that you decide, or even in a totally random way. The limits to which we are tied to create spatiality are undrawn, but even so the abstract methods remain the same, that is why this collection refers to space as a metaphor of the place we inhabit, beyond the metaverse, the internet, electricity, the physical world, the earth and the universe.\n\n_This piece starts from the premise of the ability to create spatiality from operations as simple as move, scale, trim and rotate and from that create something new. The conception of the model starts from 4 prisms connected to each other by tubes which are stacked and based among themselves based those operations, 4 different pieces are created that speak of the same spatial logic. Finally, the construction loses its character of solidity, allowing the void to pass through the pipes that are separated from each other.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQZM5LKQkY7xkMeN4vsVn9YD1xoNPMXvmrrojUsfVsrE1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNeoip9Nyyg2r3gayRLRjsRjRcEHtJbtuZzYDZkz2dqmA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQZM5LKQkY7xkMeN4vsVn9YD1xoNPMXvmrrojUsfVsrE1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L91mzG47xaTvCd2iBAQ4ozNcNLjBbs4en"], "tags": ["architecture", "metaverse", "architectural", "morphology", "experiment", "grasshopper", "parametric", "3d"], "extra": {}}
