Unlike the meditation series where I don't have a plan, for Breathe I wanted to keep the animation in time with breathing, so as to be helpful when anxiety attacks come.\n\nThe original gif is based on the deep breathing technique I learned which is a slow deep breath in for 5 counts, hold, slow breath out for 5 counts, pause, and repeat.\n\nThe collaboration series is my hope to bring different touches to my pixel mediations. The collaborations are with 4 different artists I admire whose styles differ from mine but complement it. The results may change the initial timings and mood of the gif.\n\n@bisdvrk is a music producer, sound-designer, and psychedelic artist. His ethereal soundscapes coupled with his psychedelic galaxies make for a perfect companion to the meditative Breathe collab series.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRYU5T37TVApbEUbSvKVfD5ySbC3W1DiXHscYBzj9tPJx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdGj9RGu6QDdGx76XhjEsjzr21eYNdiNoJ7fGk5abzTTS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRYU5T37TVApbEUbSvKVfD5ySbC3W1DiXHscYBzj9tPJx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cALmpTf7EeeSBXHAX2rcnR4WAP8tSWkt6"], "tags": ["breathe", "collab", "collaboration", "psychedelic", "soundscapes", "mp4", "music", "galaxy", "space", "ethereal", "experimental", "pixelart", "stars", "meditation", "meditative", "deepbreathing", "calm", "animation", "sounddesign"], "extra": {}}
