Originally inspired in the works of the Orphists (Sonia Delaunay, Robert Delaunay and others), I created a generative paint system programming in Processing, where I declare the rules for the space and I let the machine explore different combinations. This collaboration yields pieces that feed back into the artist\u2019s mind to refine the rules and seeing how the combinations evolve. Part of an exploration related to the total cognitive space of systems, which I write more about in this article:\n\nhttps://www.iillucid.com/total-cognitive-space/\n\nMore about this collection here:\n\niillucid.com/polycircles-collection/\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez. Made with Processing, 3160x2160px png.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYPV7rrxRd94ggzwy1AWJeCs9QC1xmoV8wWKa927jrWLq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV289msNaqjX6WEb7WsQjMmCZ6axr9xpiJiKQgHKRLyub", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYPV7rrxRd94ggzwy1AWJeCs9QC1xmoV8wWKa927jrWLq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["generative", "genart", "geometric", "polycircles", "orphism", "iillucid"], "extra": {}}
