This is enough to look into different times and worlds, btw in the centre of our galaxy is nothing. There are no black holes. \ud83e\udd37\n\nThis work u can be put on the wall into the frame.\nThe size of this collage is 10000x10000.\nDPI: 300\n\n1/1 Only.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWaYBswhxCUSiUTkkowcsFgdwMsCgyequzDSo56YXvJ37", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdGR4AnBhW5gqiCbq771LKEpruHfCT7eyXV74evgwwzcY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWaYBswhxCUSiUTkkowcsFgdwMsCgyequzDSo56YXvJ37", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hE46VHQjtVhiBsYWhCRmHZ5BkdcLRJ3EM"], "tags": ["space", "aliens", "collage", "invisible", "nftcommunity", "nft", "collage"], "extra": {}}
