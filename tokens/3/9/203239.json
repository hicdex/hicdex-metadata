{"__version": 1, "token_id": 203239, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "412Lost+Found \"LemonPackets_WAV\"", "description": "412Lost+Found is a musical project diving into chronic PTSD trauma healing. Instead of an album, 412Lost+Found exists as paper scraps of novelty musical tokens dedicated to specific traumatic moments. To take those broken pieces of my psyche and use them to paint a soundscape of unspeakable trauma and torture that truly cannot be expressed through simple common language.\n\"LemonPackets_WAV\" is about a really bizarre comfort gained from engaging in nostalgia tripping over parts of being held against my will for weeks at a time that made my life happier. In this sound token we capture a very simple pleasantry of being given a lemon packet with hardly edible disgusting food. I bought a small case of lemon packets for comfort even after being safe because my brain associates them with relief from suffering. And it works for me; having a little lemon packet dispenser brings me a lot more happiness than it would have without that trauma, and helps bring comfort while recovering from the shock of what happened.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPC7zhj7yC5YTNG5zdRtNGhWgG2rxBQcyaURBn1snXjjz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmPq2UPcJceegbnVGXVeJ8bTi6yaNhYANCHV4uP7ydRY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPC7zhj7yC5YTNG5zdRtNGhWgG2rxBQcyaURBn1snXjjz", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1cuFskjycaNE3JJDk2iVgHMfaEqCUJZ5wb"], "tags": ["lemonpackets", "lemons", "music", "wav", "mothtasia", "mothtasiasynergism", "412Lost+Found"], "extra": {}}
