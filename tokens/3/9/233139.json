Hijab has undergone many shapes, styles, materials, and additional accessories to support your appearance. Indonesia is now one of the world's recognized centres for hijab fashion. Today, wearing a hijab is no longer considered old-fashioned and conservative. The meaning of the hijab also changes. Not only as a means of covering the body, but the hijab as a means of jewellery, protection, safety, and reflecting the wearer's value. Hijab as a fashion statement is now present in the daily activity of Muslim women in Indonesia. I created a new form of hijab in response to Indonesian society's daily trends.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSh7PqWpfNPsM6KwUEXN79ERKRMfzZ34wF6C4QGNUpzt5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP6cbhztvrMEufm2vdDitMogwY2NTFGqRvMjd6MTFQBzN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSh7PqWpfNPsM6KwUEXN79ERKRMfzZ34wF6C4QGNUpzt5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PQ5CvYAqxJLSdfYWznazhPtV27fQWdB8R"], "tags": ["photography", "contemporary", "visualart", "fashion", "hijab", "arumdayu"], "extra": {}}
