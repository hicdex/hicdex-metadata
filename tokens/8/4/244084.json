She has visions of you bowing down a thousand times.\n\n\nShe sees blood on the lips of her children, and dreams of scenes on crimson carpets. In her bed she has drawn out a portrait of herself. Dressed in a ragged veil, she casts her glance at you and says: 'There is no one more ridiculous than I.' Sorrow and solitude, these are the precious things.\n\n\nWhen household is quiet, and music is sweet, and love is pleasanter, than these are the moments that make you feel your life straining. You want so much to be understood, you want so much to beseech yourself. You want to be understood, you want to be undeceived.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmabJYdTvsnA53eD6eQFt46Mw677xBaHk7DF5LG6MXHj6h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeuqyJdEFjBACRZUizQZSYdJ6GdRLx92988oLuLc24kPs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmabJYdTvsnA53eD6eQFt46Mw677xBaHk7DF5LG6MXHj6h", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bchTMEsYtQLZCaRc713M5feyfxzPD87TM"], "tags": ["neural", "erotic", "abstract", "expressionism"], "extra": {}}
