She was one of the people who told me that everything in this universe has a story to tell. She used to be the person who embrace happiness in all of its meaning.\u2028\u2028\n\nOne day, she fell apart.\nShe shut doors for people who wants to walk in and greet her. She fell alone without knowing who to run to and yet, without knowing that she has everyone she can run to.\n\nI guess anyone has the right to rise and to fall. Just to make us realize that embracing life is not just about catching happiness but also to be one with any kind of desperation.\n\nI hope this writing can make her realize that there was a part of her life that has touched many hearts including mine. Then soon she will realize that she is worth every life she ever cared for. \n\n-----\n\nHi everyone! \n\nThis is the first part of a series called \u201cStories from 10 People I Once Knew\u201d. My writings in this series are responding to stories of 10 people that once have touched my heart and I\u2019d like to share them to 100 other people.\n\nHopefully you can feel the stories together with me and you can re-share them to anyone else that might need warm words. \n\nHugs,\nYY\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPMJ85ackVqyfo2E6rCoqvbjg2XMgaMGwrqDBWigHBqb3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTUcx6sLLuSobPE5bmKcnfbZuK8EGsXPPFUSAB3u3vAuy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPMJ85ackVqyfo2E6rCoqvbjg2XMgaMGwrqDBWigHBqb3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XSa1ZQ8ECTUL7dwEZKbpqoCs52My3Mnhx"], "tags": ["writing", "poem", "poetry", "indonesianwriter", "art", "digital"], "extra": {}}
