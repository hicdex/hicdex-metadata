After some editing, these characters just came to life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbJEsqRXDMsm8PQeh3NBZyG66RimFSLbqfqxxGCQRpJah", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWa9WAdBkwW6s1mV3AZSUXKFmzgfsrKyU4agNzWnQ6Bd6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbJEsqRXDMsm8PQeh3NBZyG66RimFSLbqfqxxGCQRpJah", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZuXpzkdPKxGupK5CFM1zHPDtGh1PD9BKK"], "tags": ["Pillow", "Sofa", "Leather", "Digitalart", "Photography", "Fineart", "creachers", "madness"], "extra": {}}
