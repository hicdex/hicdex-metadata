Your pulse is far from steady. Your palms are sweaty already and you look slim and shady, is that vomit on your sweater? This won\u2019t get better.\n\nTo stand on top of giants to get a better view might seem like an admirable and noble pursuit: people of repute, toot, scoot, and flute would never ever dare to utter refute - but shoot! Knifes hiding on their boots, we might be en route to some kind of dispute. In the name of science and say goodwill, we might encounter some people that are ill: vil, vile, despicable, and mean, they would only approach a god to get a better kill. \n\nSo fill the tanks but don\u2019t lower your gaze, watch like a soldier with eyes of x-rays, we are here to protect a place unpolluted, don\u2019t let them start wars just because it\u2019s well suited.\n\nTribute to John Karel @jjjjjjjjjjohn\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdJjpwfUFcrffgWUsT39Q4bQJpDiEebm2FZTuDL4777hW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ361JC7hxoJckYNnWphU3HhE9T9hjrSBXWw2kEjd1eP9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdJjpwfUFcrffgWUsT39Q4bQJpDiEebm2FZTuDL4777hW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aQKoJYGJTZRNDjunJVuPmJeZPKsrRvpBZ"], "tags": ["blender", "3d", "story", "illustration", "color"], "extra": {}}
