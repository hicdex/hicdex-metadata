The first 11 seconds of original soundtrack for the objekt porting to  non fungible token of the audiovisual artwork \"RE_w-03 [Resolution of the Energy _white]\". This is procedural sound I made with my custom instrument - node based synthesizer I created by myself with custom coding in the software of Max/Msp. It is a combination of generative \"golden ratio\" based sequencer, additive synthesis and some tricks with realtime rhythmic/harmonic structure.  All components are recorded in realtime from the live algorithm.  Mixed into one. listen / use / mix.  No sound effects are used. Pure wave physics.
