This landscape devoid of people, suggest the calm of holidays, wish-for peace and escapism. This work and the others in the series appeared as I adapted to the pandemic restrictions of time and space, as a working artist and mother of young kids. I swapped my oil and their usually slow process for gel plates, stencils, acrylic and spray paints, in order to get a bulk of prep works to intervened at home. This work is effectively art from the pandemic. This series depict landscapes that use figurative, recognizable elements spray painted,  placed as in a collage over a unplanned background, a gel plate monoprint using acrylic paint and stencils.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSYc1AF7X7mVLMeN5TtMyXptHSaiZUBCg6wWQF2kGCqyW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmayQuye9MWmu6FAzYJyUp7NNKuTSr8vjkavYeUnPD1hoA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSYc1AF7X7mVLMeN5TtMyXptHSaiZUBCg6wWQF2kGCqyW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TpRb6NCM7PTFANkmk95u6gxWy23XGuTfW"], "tags": ["landscape", "holiday", "beach", "pool", "poolside", "Maldives", "Caribbean", "resort", "tropics", "tropical", "tropicalplants", "plants", "garden", "tropicalgarden"], "extra": {}}
