A journey that teaches one; that you are never truly alone. As ether flows everywhere. Connecting the worlds and the universe, the seen and the unseen. Beings of the higher and lower dimensions. As the wolf howls, lighting up this essence of creation. Remember, you are never alone. Feel this ether around you filling up your mind, body and spirit with bliss, love and compassion. Be in this very moment dear ones.
