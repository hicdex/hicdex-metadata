What childhood memories are you most fond of?\n\nThis illustration started on paper. Drawn with pencil and refined with fineliner. Afterwards it was scanned and digitally enhanced in Photoshop to create the strong contrast between black and white.\n\nThe illustration resembles one's childhood memories of being an astronaut (or cosmonaut if you will). The sky was not even the limit. Playing around, enjoying, having fun. A nostalgic display for you to enjoy, to remember and to long back for simpler times.
