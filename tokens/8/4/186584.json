I was laying down looking out the sliding door into the distant horizon. In my field of vision, as I was laying, the world was horizontal: sky extending infinitely to the left, Earth towards the right. After a couple minutes the realization and visceral experience hit me that \u201cup\u201d was a relative concept. That if I could imagine myself temporarily detached from Earth\u2019s gravity, then I would be able to see that up/down, in a general sense, is a linguistic construct used for general communication. With closer examination one could see it\u2019s an immersive illusion facilitated by the immense effect of Earth\u2019s gravity; without gravity, the idea of up/down begins to fall apart. After that experience I would apply that understanding to all other landscapes. This is especially intriguing when considering bodies of water and how it \u201csticks\u201d to Earth. This NFT illustrates such a perspective. It\u2019s curious that a horizontal visual orientation is actually just as accurate a depiction of reality than any other.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPX5Nbj2iGzxXKrip1YtmHmx2zyLfm9HCFFSoxh5GFKeA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfBgP1LeZoRA6yFhs6CTQG1SYmmPTFeKXzKVFV1mChAA2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPX5Nbj2iGzxXKrip1YtmHmx2zyLfm9HCFFSoxh5GFKeA", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1LBayeDsbbgDu7euVnKB8WywgNGkemvZiV"], "tags": ["photography", "videography", "lake", "mountains", "horizon", "water", "blue", "grey", "perspective", "gravity", "physics", "broscience"], "extra": {}}
