I want to share the way I see them with you and how beautiful are the interactions between color. Focusing on color interaction such as we notice it is not always self-evident, with simple geometry, distances, Joseph really found a way to enhance our means to see it, making it easier for us to focus on the core of color perception.\n\nThis is why I picked up Trapcode TAO and in an attempt to show you how it is perceived when I look at it.
