He started exploring space in 1997. We see space as if it is empty or nothing's in there.

Like humans living in this space. Every existence has its own \ncolor, shape, energy, aura, and beauty! \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQyShYsMzFwHFs9YtTaWRHcJNWbbPoE6cSDsUmSZierG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmerZgDonokh7cxyDe2RorNFpzGkWbdHLxgHBLbvjujeyU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQyShYsMzFwHFs9YtTaWRHcJNWbbPoE6cSDsUmSZierG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PztuURkUJcRYXixUUYaUpb6N9uyNQ456y"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "jakestudyos", "psychedelicart", "EXPLORATIONOFSPACE"], "extra": {}}
