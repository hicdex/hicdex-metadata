{"__version": 1, "token_id": 205486, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Noisy Partitions", "description": "Noisy Partitions is a generative artwork with 50 1/1 unique editions. When this OBJKT is burned, a unique 1/1 OBJKT (3000 x 3000 png) is generated using the wallet address and hash of the burn operation as a seed for the generation process. Once the new OBJKT has been generated, it is minted and transferred to the wallet who initiated the burn operation. The royalties on the generated OBJKT will be the same as this OBJKT (15 percent). This video provides lo-res (1000 x 1000) examples of what the generations look like (actual generated OBJKTS will look less grainy). Since generating a single OBJKT takes about 30 minutes, and all generation occurs in series, there will be a waiting period before the generated OBJKT is transferred in your wallet.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYxuxLDnwFFERg8ajVqCbeC3rHe8JJ7RDDLxUQDxQkMGd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQyDXXq6xextwkFzsnxb5cFXAYbQ8fTJu5kQRfs5oixa3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYxuxLDnwFFERg8ajVqCbeC3rHe8JJ7RDDLxUQDxQkMGd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RkYY3jr1ocuPdQqrRefr5FqoawKQsmBmD"], "tags": ["GENERATIVE", "MINIMALIST", "ABSTRACT"], "extra": {}}
