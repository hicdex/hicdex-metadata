This process is repeated until the bounding box prevents any more lines being drawn.\n\nThese artworks form what was my first digital attempt, drawn in a moving vehicle for extra error.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUNfC1YfAWHgKfaNdWSGCVJQSqGR8uKpX3JcqL78jQQTM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmpuhiTQpkzNzXbs451ahTFHx4MJvnUbtJmsPnpcg4qB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUNfC1YfAWHgKfaNdWSGCVJQSqGR8uKpX3JcqL78jQQTM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "digitaldrawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
