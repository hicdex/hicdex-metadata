As an open-source software library it is not only widely used by ML engineers and developers, but also shapes the way we imagine, think, and actually organize artificial intelligence today. On the basis of a walkthrough through the likewise popular Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) offered by Google, this entry will critically engage with some of the fundamental assumptions of TensorFlow and machine learning in general.\u201d\n\u2013 Clemens Apprich\n\nClemens Apprich is a professor of media theory and media history at the University of Applied Arts, Vienna (Austria). His current research deals with filter algorithms and their application in data analysis as well as machine learning methods.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvLgfXFmYFJKsKK32v1SvwG327bjE5NETQRZShQPQEJe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeXNVoimKgGgtiZihKAJeAZrtL2ZodY14NQtfBA3o3phj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvLgfXFmYFJKsKK32v1SvwG327bjE5NETQRZShQPQEJe", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NisvvqYZE1dgsJTY14XL64xbsNudSAgTS"], "tags": ["TensorFlow", "ClemensApprich", "KunstvereininHamburg", "SimonDenny", "ProofofStake"], "extra": {}}
