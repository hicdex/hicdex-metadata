Exorcists wear these devil masks & dance to traditional music to ward off evil demons that cause diseases by possessing their victims. The demon portrayed in this illustration is believed to have been born from a curse by the wrongdoing of an ancient king in Sri Lanka. According to folklore, the demon went on to kill the king and destroy his kingdom. Later, the demon was tamed by the Lord Buddha and banished to the spirit world before causing more destruction. \n\nOriginal concept and digital illustration by Thison Nayanake from Ceylon Metaverse.
