On the other hand, if your actions caused pain to others, this card serves as a warning. Her appearance represents a chance for you to change your actions now for a better future. When a tarot card reading shows the figure of justice, it is time to account for your actions.\n\nThe decisions that you make now have long-term effects in all things, both for yourself and others. There will always come a time where you will be judged. The Justice tarot card appearing in a reading signals that a judgment will be made fairly and accordingly. The decisions that you have made in the past will be carefully weighed with fairness. Your feelings around this card may differ depending on your situation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidrrtge6li6vgeuf5w4ivwc4m4sk5eszpnl2zh5nov6gtordsij7y", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiaiq6pjnhlxzc2d2jvef7yr5pjvbzeaty5m3majncrylpshtmno3i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidrrtge6li6vgeuf5w4ivwc4m4sk5eszpnl2zh5nov6gtordsij7y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1enACDiHTRGsVwS9XxrXuiz84ZABdTtdkm"], "tags": ["neural", "generative", "ai", "tarot", "surreal", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
