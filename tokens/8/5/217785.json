Through ArtOwly, these artists have switched on to a new platform exploring the world of NFTs.\n\nRavi\u2019s works engage with the politics of migration and urbanisation. His work depicts disasters that are by-products of human civilisation. The image of a mushroom cloud recurs in his works, reminding us of the greatest crime by the human hand, the \u2018nuclear explosion\u2019. The tiny houses that pepper the whole landscape and the yellow colour scheme that resembles the polluted smog of industrial cities reflect the inclement disasters, which humans have brought upon themselves.\n\nRavi Chaurasiya is an Interdisciplinary artist living and working in New Delhi. His works mostly talk about humanity\u2019s actions towards nature and its aftermath.\n\n\n\nWatercolour on paper / 48 x 48 Inches.\n\nN.B. Shipping charges are extra.\n\nView our exhibition at: https://artowly.com/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcYp6mqk1NgBqbMMuyTuEwgHpRpeh3MMbo125tEYZduuM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSnrBhToZ8adAKFAmZ75Gfms1moNkx7Aq9zfSjX1HBqpQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcYp6mqk1NgBqbMMuyTuEwgHpRpeh3MMbo125tEYZduuM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2AfkJA16p4L1hmanKPv3eg6v7XepLknQJW"], "tags": ["Hoot_hoot", "Switch_on", "migration", "urbanisation", "humanity", "painting"], "extra": {}}
