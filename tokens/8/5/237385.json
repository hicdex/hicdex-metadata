Near the end of the star\u2019s life of fusion, the star\u2019s gravity weakens as it loses mass. The star expands into a red giant and begins shedding layers of gas from its atmosphere into space. As those layers travel outward, they\u2019re ionised by ultraviolet radiation from the star buried in the middle of all that beauty.
