In Indonesia, graffiti is often used as a form of criticism of the government which ultimately raises pros and cons in society. Many graffiti actors have been arrested/hunted for by the authorities because they are considered disturbing the comfort of the community. This illustration responds to several past events that have become public discussion, the emergence of critical scribbles that were removed by the government and the perpetrators arrested, many of whom think the current government is anti-democratic, because Indonesia is a country that adheres to a democratic system.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcKJRMgDtt3bNyFJsiUkmVGbEXBxikRGcSC1mQ3XWgQhp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX1xz8GxGbU7iZtP31f2FC8CjJyL2cDYsguDiLzZJ9duh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcKJRMgDtt3bNyFJsiUkmVGbEXBxikRGcSC1mQ3XWgQhp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i4uQqz5fgL9HPs8Q1iYdarRBqp8ib544W"], "tags": ["illustration", "painting", "graffiti", "vandalisme", "social", "popculture", "contemporaryart"], "extra": {}}
