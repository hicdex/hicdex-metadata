Memory Restoration As A Service. \n\nThese pieces each begin with a photograph I took on a plastic-lens camera, between 2008 and 2010. From the moment they were taken, often on film with intentional damage, they were beginning to break down. Over a decade later, that version of myself is someone I only know through artifacts like these. It's been said that every time you play a memory back, you rewrite it -- in this case, they were rearranged and put back together programmatically. \n\nAfter having a series of conversations with an OpenAI bot about memory, youth, and specifically 2009, I superimposed the algorithmically generated insights over my own failing mental images. Surprisingly, working through this has helped me remember. I hope it helps you remember as well.\n\n1/1 of 50", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiapxt7owjlmjo5nfkhfkfoi3sg3xmtn2uxzgtk6rr76pmnx2cwpgq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigiedoklry576akcbjxyvwsyhlvwoxubod5ihfkyohtsyk2nb2k3e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiapxt7owjlmjo5nfkhfkfoi3sg3xmtn2uxzgtk6rr76pmnx2cwpgq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NgFNSWMaUuxiTCLHRu9ppXfsro8iG7fFm"], "tags": ["openai", "literary", "generativeart", "creativecoding", "processing", "glitchart", "photography"], "extra": {}}
