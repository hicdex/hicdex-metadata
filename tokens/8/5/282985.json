Unfortunately, he and several other people of this Brazilian Pantanal ethnic group died from an influenza epidemic, according to Schmidt's descriptions. There are currently only two Guat\u00f3 speakers left and the traditional songs have already been lost (when I did this painting, was three, REST IN PIECE EUFR\u00c1SIA!), all due to the violence they have suffered for hundreds of years.
