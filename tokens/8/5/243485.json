Set in saturated tones, AI-generated figures formed from collective imagery set from user-sent pictures now present themselves new. What follows are pseudo memories that question us about their existence. Did these memories hold a name in the past?

Nonetheless, as specimens now with new user names, they are captured again.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfC69YjZVD1dBj8qQPB7oVjqLmADwyLKL7S7duTutrCBU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR8Qj8EhXFiL67utiq8sj4L5QnqdyvyS548HVBJNFEPoD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfC69YjZVD1dBj8qQPB7oVjqLmADwyLKL7S7duTutrCBU", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XR6K5u8atyJGJjm6EawvnwGq7odbMKmzQ"], "tags": ["gan", "generativeart", "ganart", "generative", "past", "present", "future", "machinelearning", "neuralnetwork", "contemporaryart", "digitalart", "modernart", "surrealism", "surreal", "aiart", "jettroxx", "memory", "untitledmemories", "popart", "photomanipulation"], "extra": {}}
