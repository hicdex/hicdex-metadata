The first was a single sheet of black construction paper, cut with an exacto knife.  No drawing, just cutting.  THe cutout became a screen print.  Then, in 1996, I revisted the image with oil pastels.  I consider this piece to be the best of the lot.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n~Ahearn", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWEZpjawEe8sbWcv4fiL5XVzBYCdqisGdVBCrRwzhLQef", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbaHDwe4AXTvLP7hz3aa8Jrw3UV5VLdBWgknSigRE5EHu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWEZpjawEe8sbWcv4fiL5XVzBYCdqisGdVBCrRwzhLQef", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d8Q2nYgawkGaMb2RXispf1tsFDt9b9SUG"], "tags": ["drawing", "oilpastel"], "extra": {}}
