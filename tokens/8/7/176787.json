This landscape devoid of people, suggest the calm of holidays, wish-for peace and escapism. This work and the others in the series appeared as I adapted to the pandemic restrictions of time and space, as a working artist and mother of young kids. I swapped my oil and their usually slow process for gel plates, stencils, acrylic and spray paints, in order to get a bulk of prep works to intervened at home. This work is effectively art from the pandemic. This series depict landscapes that use figurative, recognizable elements spray painted,  placed as in a collage over a unplanned background, a gel plate monoprint using acrylic paint and stencils.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUDd4CBj3KPLT7jcDQ3Xk97VyaBjD2cCF7aD2Dq8dLDrd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS6HP5DumVWPJijsBUvhgmC48AD2sUy3wo8vsdWQmQkpC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUDd4CBj3KPLT7jcDQ3Xk97VyaBjD2cCF7aD2Dq8dLDrd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TpRb6NCM7PTFANkmk95u6gxWy23XGuTfW"], "tags": ["holiday", "Caribbean", "Maldives", "exotic", "landscape", "poolside", "pool", "beach", "beachresort", "holidays", "tropical", "tropics", "tropicalplants", "tropicalgarden", "cuba"], "extra": {}}
