One day, while moping through the art gallery feeling lonely and sad, they stumbled across the work of Damien Hirst. Aha! Hugamonster thought. Who needs stripes when you can have lots of colorful spots? Hugamonster went to Hirst\u2019s studio and asked if Hugamonsters could have spots too, just like his artworks. Of course! said Hirst. Spots for everyone! I\u2019d be delighted to give you some spots too.\n\n*this is not a true story \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbVq6PwHUHwo2K565nJEQ73P6eaEcVtX5pnCS9obCt1fE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQW83agMrXPDU4SnQgojuZRuJBQ7M1rSV8Qg2ycGDR2px", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbVq6PwHUHwo2K565nJEQ73P6eaEcVtX5pnCS9obCt1fE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YzN4Ns4DMSYV9TcS2NyMuX9AfMFdS6CEh"], "tags": ["hugamonster", "dots", "spots", "rainbow"], "extra": {}}
