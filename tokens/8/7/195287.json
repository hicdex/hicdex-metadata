It existed in another spectral space, beyond our understanding, devoid of physics as we know it! I was able to get this screengrab of the mind-numbing cosmic monstrosity that lurked on the other side of the screen. I swear it could also SEE ME! I think it even tried to communicate ... before, luckily, the portal collapsed as my battery ran out.\n\nWhat if it were able to...
