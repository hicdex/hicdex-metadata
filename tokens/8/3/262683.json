If you make NFT gadgets, please visit https://zimjs.com/gadgetminters.\n\nTouch\u00e9 Truchet starts with random patterns but you can drag them or press to rotate and press and hold to flip colors. Use the ZIM Panel with Arrow, Tab, ColorPicker and Button components. Sweep select multiple shapes to adjust their colors, copy, delete, move and rotate as well swap or unify colors. \n\nPatterns made from the gadget have been used as a dance floor in the PagodaScope AltspaceVR world, as animated backdrops for Beatles and StereoLab videos. They can make strange characters that can be used as avatars. \n\nThe making of the app is not as simple as one might imagine. The patterns with multiple sizes, need to snap in certain places. ZIM Model View Controller is used to keep the app organized.
