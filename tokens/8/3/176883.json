It is what allows us to dream, unlock layers of knowledge, break barriers, in the physical and digital world. Creating possibilities to create the unimaginable and produce a better future.\n\n//\n\n\nThe \"Menor Portando\" project was born to explore and discuss different trajectories for young people, slum dwellers. Where the lack of opportunity is present, and the laws of parallel power quickly take over. The absence of basic resources prevent young people from dreaming and imagining new paths. Navigating the past, living the present and drawing our future. We will arm ourselves with different tools, combining the use of technology to flourish, grow and change our destinies.\n\nThis is a Tibum Residence, Socrialcryptoart and Ademafia Institute collaboration.\n\n\nhttps://geancg.com.br/ - MOF\nhttps://www.instagram.com/geancg/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdUjaEfnYmzVvjVvy3Z712u6aXgoj4qGpGS34kkf5mc1k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQttLuea31czxvfd3pPtDBaKZmA1cTtgKjvsEXbKNkLi9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdUjaEfnYmzVvjVvy3Z712u6aXgoj4qGpGS34kkf5mc1k", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iuwVep6tvB6PM8nnPCp1LPMGssWLi6gr3"], "tags": ["3d", "photogrammetry", "tibumresidency", "socialcryptoart", "brasil", "favela", "riodejaneiro", "ademafia", "ademafiainstitute", "RJ", "menorportando", "cria", "morrosantoamaro", "technology", "future", "skateboard", "ak47"], "extra": {}}
