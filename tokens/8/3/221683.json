This irreversible move wiped out 12 years of corporate executive experience and over 1300 prominent contacts with a couple clicks.  That world has disappeared from the rear view mirror.\n\nTo commemorate the moment, this objkt shows the confirmation receipt from LinkedIn of the account closure.  The success that has lead to this moment lies firmly in The Grotto.  So, this mint was initially airdropped to integral and active Grotto members.  No further editions will ever be minted.\n\nJoin thr33som3s, as you SWIPE TO OPEN all the possibility that lay ahead.\n\nAny wallet which holds Swipe to Open is given EXCLUSIVE access to certain thr33som3s utilities. It also serves as your entry pass to private spaces in The Grotto.  These are detailed in posted utility statements in The Grotto discord.\n\nOnly holders of the Thr33 Thr33 3dition are granted additional \"33 Utility & Access\" - these are also to be posted in The Grotto.\n\nTHANK YOU, GROTTO.  YOUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.  I WILL ALWAYS DO ALL I CAN TO MAINTAIN COLLECTOR VALUE AND I WILL NEVER FUCK ANYONE OVER.\n--- thr33som3s\n\nAll thr33som3s have further utility.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSSdA5ry44dQCtK5MGjwMzE1y7rnVeo4TRYU7VCUbh8Pr", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc9xgrqxma8qHzxYVEdkF3x1kn22hc7SbG9pNAASZe342", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSSdA5ry44dQCtK5MGjwMzE1y7rnVeo4TRYU7VCUbh8Pr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MvePPBoQGqesNJ4x3VRf2bn81it7kGjCc"], "tags": ["thr33som3s"], "extra": {}}
