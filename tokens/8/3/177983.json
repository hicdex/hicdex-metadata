{"__version": 1, "token_id": 177983, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Process over product", "description": "This NFT isn\u2019t a final artistic product, but rather a representation of our never-ending process of development. The type of dance in this video is a technique we\u2019ve developed for training, and wouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for the kind of finished choreographic work we produce. While dance class is for training, it\u2019s also how we\u2019ve always paid for our company, dancers, and ourselves -- and it\u2019s how we connect with and provide for the community regularly. For us, class and NFTs provide more sustainable funding options that work cyclically through connection with a community. In this way, this NFT is representative of our value of process and the acknowledgement for our community. \n\n20% of the profits from this NFT sale will go to dancers and cameraperson (who is also a dancer). \n\nWe\u2019re also selling this NFT for the price of class - and as a ticket to class - so we can encourage more dancers to join the community as buyers and to familiarize them with the process as well as utilize NFTs as a unique and secure ticketing mechanism.
