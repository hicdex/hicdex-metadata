Therefore, the most literal translation for maneki-neko in English is \u201ca beckoning cat\u201d. The cat has its paw raised as if it\u2019s waving in good fortune for its owners.\n\nFun Fact: Meowth from the Pok\u00e9mon franchise was inspired by Maneki Neko!\n\nThank you for reading!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXTS88TmggZRP265X4EKcY2ov1mQanzrFZKKvx32PS5XU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNmfmeWzdAre322yaKkVJio9KiSnpGsELrJDAxLPuLLMa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXTS88TmggZRP265X4EKcY2ov1mQanzrFZKKvx32PS5XU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ri5S9CweEQwGvDkLBf4SSDV2jbiu1KMqd"], "tags": ["art", "3dart", "card", "3dcard", "japan", "neko", "cat", "culture", "nft", "nftcommunity"], "extra": {}}
