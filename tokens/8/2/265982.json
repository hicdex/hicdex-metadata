The user can (but does not have to) take control of the drawing by modifying the algorithm through its graphical representation (\"the machine\") and by setting pen color and size.\n\nBased on the mathematical principle of the Fourier series.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- Sound on! Click once into the canvas to start sound.\n\n- The work reacts to keyboard input only after the user has clicked into the canvas or hit return key at least once.\n\n- When the movement stops, Monsieur Fourier wants to remind the user that they can interact with the machine.\n\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| Take control                                             |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n  Toggle between DRAW and EDIT mode             [return key]\n\n  Toggle PAUSE                                   [space bar]\n\n  Toggle RAINBOWS                                        [c]\n\n  Change PEN COLOR                             [mouse wheel]\n\n  Change PEN SIZE                                    [+] [-]\n\n  DELETE drawing                               [right-click]\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following things are possible in EDIT mode only:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlace mouse cursor somewhere on the canvas, but not on a segment.
