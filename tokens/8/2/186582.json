Chesapeake is a collaborative work by Anne Grgich with sound by husband Steve Fisk.\n\n\n\"The art of Anne Marie Grgich feeds on, and grows strength from, accumulation. She piles image upon image. Sometimes words upon words. For the last couple of decades, collage has been the primary architecture of an Anne Grgich artwork. Back at the turn of the century, collaged elements often acted as a kind of base superstructure or foundation for her iconic painted figures. These images were sealed in complex layers of resin and paint that created enigmatic depths. Collage and painted lines and shapes existed in an easy inter-relationship from which visual meaning emerged.\"-Colin Rhodes 2019 full article Raw Vision Magazine Woman Issue 103  https://rawvision.com/articles/balancing-books\n\nMt.
