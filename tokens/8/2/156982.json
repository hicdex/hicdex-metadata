This series of artwork demonstrates a method in which to address a fraction of time. To explore the depth at which one can experience a moment in the form of viewing a situation from a variety of perspectives to make up the whole picture. A common experience when viewing these images is confusion and surprise. This process occurs when your brain experiences something new and calls upon your back catalogue of experience and visual stimuli to try to explain what you are seeing by filling the space with a suggestion that is a close comparison to what you are seeing, and how to act. This is called a Prediction. Enjoy your very own Predictions!
