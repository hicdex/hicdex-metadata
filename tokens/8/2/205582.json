Growing up in The Depression and making her way through Hollywood in the \u201940s, she encountered resistance \u2014 to her skin color, to her refusal to play demeaning roles \u2014 at every turn. She was assailed in the press for dating white men, and blamed herself for her husband\u2019s philandering and her daughter\u2019s brain damage. Nearly every societal convention was against her. And yet she managed to make a handful of gorgeous, invigorating films \u2014 films that offer a glimpse at the superstar she would have become if the studios knew what to do with a beautiful black woman.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVNvGTcQwdLMofBwbVFBVZrLFyNkxrYP4Cv1EQLZh2Ss8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPZV1Wzp46D478aSMaAzNHHWgXtTobN5si6W8kn1hB5Ke", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVNvGTcQwdLMofBwbVFBVZrLFyNkxrYP4Cv1EQLZh2Ss8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
