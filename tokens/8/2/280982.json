This piece was part of a larger work also called \"Obsidian Edge\" exhibited for one month (from the 17th of June till the 17th of July) on \"One Trick Pony\" gallery, located in the Fairfax av., Hollywood, Los Angeles. \n\nThis piece was originally made in 2020 for the exhibition \"Profetas del futuro\" and named \"Acetobacter\". In colaboration with the argentine glitch artist melon_manga, Daniela re-imagined the work for the \"Obsidian Edge\" exhibition.\n\n\"With the video, the viewer sees her in the process of constructing the inorganic out of the organic. This life cycle, animate to inanimate and back again, conceptually loops in the exhibition Obsidian Edge in the same manner as the video on repeat upon its walls.\"\n\nThis is the first piece of the Obsidian Edge series.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaawj35uz3pq2l7q5r2moxohq3q7uiazromm47x2fmodwiu3cmk5q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiab7qfpuntmax57n6fox4c7r4rj3qkidmo52ic5utsi7wlzw5cgme", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaawj35uz3pq2l7q5r2moxohq3q7uiazromm47x2fmodwiu3cmk5q", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1aZuHsTPBAhyMFz1KranPKpwfCNNRAkH9y"], "tags": ["glitch", "videoart", "performativevideo", "crt", "analog", "vhs", "glitchart"], "extra": {}}
