Finally, the second card in the uncanny NEW KRYPTO KICKS series has been conjured into this plane of existence! The image for this piece was created in collaboration with the brilliant, two-year-old, conceptual artist, Felicity Echo Hanson (my granddaughter---who has already sold more NFTs than many seasoned veterans)! (She chose where to place the \"EYES\" on the ghost's face.) As far as ghosts go, this sad little fellow seems a bit unsure of his place in the world. Do your part! Give him a bit of a boost, and help show him he belongs! (Although...to be fair...you might want to steer clear of those teeth...) ---Richard F.
