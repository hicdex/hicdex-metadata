The local butcher is a very nice man called Vlad and he gives me some beef and porc scraps for free when I go buy something at his store. These greasy meat scraps that remains when he prepare is chops are salvaged instead of going to waste. The grease from the beef scraps helped them incorporate proteins and build strength to survive the cold winter season. 100% profits from these NFT will be invested in the improvement of my the little paradise we have built for them.
