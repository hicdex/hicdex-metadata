Effect used is a Kuassa Efektor RV3604 Reverb and I use Kuassa Kratos 2 Maximizer on the mastering chain.\n\nThe Benjolinis a multi-function synthesizer designed by Rob Hordijk in 2009. The module consists of four separate function blocks: two VCOs, a state variable filter and an additional circuit, invented by Hordijk himself, called a rungler. This particular arrangement emerged from Hordijk\u2019s efforts to design a synthesizer that was, as he puts it, \"bent by design\". As such, the module functions according to principles of chaos theory, where short to long sputtering patterns spontaneously transform themselves, at times, gradually, at others, quite suddenly, morphing into new pattern doublings and bifurcations. The chaotic character of the Benjolinis anchored in Hordijk\u2019s rungler circuit.\n\nTuring Machine is a random looping sequencer that spits out basslines and melodies. It generates strings of random voltages that can be locked into looping sequences. These sequences can be allowed to slip, changing gradually over time. This module was inspired by the long history of shift register pseudorandom synth circuits, including the Triadex Muse, Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty and Grant Richter\u2019s Noisering. Turing Machine inspired by Alan Turing\u2019s Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc38CFXSkhca4Tdy26y9cUwbN73KEhtQQkcaodcWvaQPc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWdPHoH4XrS8EiN3QbWgbgkpzNXjuJ45YfpfEQDkVdVu6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc38CFXSkhca4Tdy26y9cUwbN73KEhtQQkcaodcWvaQPc", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RwDjHjbkxmAMbVJf2j482zaZaToYToonE"], "tags": ["DeathlessXLoudsonic", "loudsonic", "deathless", "deathlessramz", "ambient", "experimental", "drone", "dronemusic", "audio", "sound", "mp3", "music", "henradio", "modularsynthesizer", "eurorackmodular", "NFTaudio", "HENmusic", "HENaudio", "hicetnuncaudio", "Indonesia", "Indonesiaaudio", "electronic", "modular", "beats", "downtempo", "lofi", "song", "synth", "song", "instrumental", "experimental", "noise", "sounddesign", "improv", "improvisation", "synthesizer", "NFTart", "NFTcollector", "kolektifkolektoranabel", "artwork", "illustration", "internationalstrangemusicday", "strange"], "extra": {}}
