He was born in Italy but moved to Paris to pursue a career in art. Modigliani died prematurely at the age of 35. His lifestyle was defined by stereotypical bohemian characteristics of poverty, womanizing, excessive alcohol, narcotics and overworking.\n\nIn what has become fairly accepted folklore Picasso idolized Modigliani and Picasso asked him to move in during World War I to act as a mentor and critique his art despite Picasso\u2019s already economic success. Modigliani rebuffed him and was fond of humiliating him in public. Picasso never got over being slighted by Amedeo and on his deathbed, over fifty years after Modigliani died the last words Picasso ever said are alleged to be \u201cModigliani, Modigliani,\u201d and with that he took his last breathe and died.\n\nIndonesian Based Artist\nTwitter : @trustno1one25", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmevD6qRXnJGX77N8tMt9ZXt4WzqDxBhhd8cn1ZXBtVzHP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPQCGatcoShdaUbba1GSjuVLGqaxpqnvWs5kv62htbZbb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmevD6qRXnJGX77N8tMt9ZXt4WzqDxBhhd8cn1ZXBtVzHP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LXqFEW1hWXnYJQZgHn9fZqGZnUunanK55"], "tags": ["Basquiat", "Modigliani", "PrimitiveArt", "DigitalArt", "FineArt", "Illustration"], "extra": {}}
