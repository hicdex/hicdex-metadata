Hard liquor and fist fighting forever!\nBlack Vincent\u2019s ride, The Duc of Orange, is by far the sleekest vehicle in the Crew: a quad turbofan unlimited atmosphere bike built by the elder of the greatest racing clan of Celeritas 3. Vince insists he won the Duc in fair and open competition, but an explanation more generally believed is that it was acquired after a disagreement between Vince and the elder: he believed Vince  wouldn\u2019t just murder him for the vehicle,  Vince disagreed.\nIn battle, Black Vincent and The Duc of Orange are first to the fight, bringing the pain along with the vanguard of other speedy crewsters, like Scratchnasty and Vince\u2019s biker rival, Fat Bob on The Octopus.\nBetween raids, Vince can be found home in the warping scablands, bullseyeing squigrats, even though they\u2019re not much bigger than two metres.\nScratchbuilt model, photographed and altered digitally, one of a series with interlocking narratives.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZJv276zBWH4SUuv7CF1mVUhCwZpjSrQyAuDYDLK4qc8X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZJv276zBWH4SUuv7CF1mVUhCwZpjSrQyAuDYDLK4qc8X", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZJv276zBWH4SUuv7CF1mVUhCwZpjSrQyAuDYDLK4qc8X", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SmgSukHrJR9JsqiMUibLXgsNCAFeXAehM"], "tags": ["OlCrowCrew", "cryptoart", "scifi"], "extra": {}}
