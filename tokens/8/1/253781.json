In the Circular Artifacts series, this process is repeated, but ignores the finality of the bounding box - lines are drawn continuously until the circle is filled.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYuzXszrkT5z6qSSgwp9uSdLWc2KPnAsUwGbh334iDrcv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPmFzmU1YPDd7dUCUvBVtS4RyD7cM2qNYwsnn1KrY7rJn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYuzXszrkT5z6qSSgwp9uSdLWc2KPnAsUwGbh334iDrcv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "circle", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "digitaldrawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
