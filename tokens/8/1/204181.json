It will be enough just to take one step and you will be able to take off, and you will be able to take off on your feet will no longer be. Only infinite height.

I sit on this shore for hours and watch the stars await the birth of a new star. - \nMarina Matisse 1991 year", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSEaJrdnfC26tXDKYbku3kE4WdPbmt4wTZk59xbqqscTp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVBKdTQaUDFdtmo497Ckf3fxcaaUvnGEFipas4PGB4zkW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSEaJrdnfC26tXDKYbku3kE4WdPbmt4wTZk59xbqqscTp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e1i15FaQ4kXTyUAMiGX5qAc6cRDUDWBJB"], "tags": ["#art#bird#"], "extra": {}}
