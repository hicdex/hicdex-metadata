{"__version": 1, "token_id": 258681, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Disambiguation #002", "description": "The Disambiguation collection is the first in a series of generative optical art experiments using simple motion and creating a mesmerizing flicker effect with the interaction of shapes and contrasting color builds. Each piece is unique 1/1 and contains a 15 second motion loop created in adobe after effects with original ambient composition that I created in Reason and a matching 2000 x 2000 JPG.\n\nDisambiguation refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear. The shape used in this piece is a typographic [bracket] character which does just that when placed in a sentence.
