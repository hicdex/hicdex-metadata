{"__version": 1, "token_id": 235788, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30dc\u30b1 v2", "description": "Bokeh is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image. Bokeh has also been defined as \"the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light\". Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause very different bokeh effects. Some lens designs blur the image in a way that is pleasing to the eye, while others produce distracting or unpleasant blurring (\"good\" and \"bad\" bokeh, respectively). Photographers may deliberately use a shallow focus technique to create images with prominent out-of-focus regions, accentuating their lens's bokeh.\n\nThe term comes from the Japanese word boke (\u6688\u3051 or \u30dc\u30b1), which means \"blur\" or \"haze\", or boke-aji (\u30dc\u30b1\u5473), the \"blur quality\". This is derived as a noun form of the verb bokeru, which is written in several ways, with additional meanings and nuances: \u6688\u3051\u308b refers to being blurry, hazy or out-of-focus, whereas the \u60da\u3051\u308b and \u5446\u3051\u308b spellings refer to being mentally hazy, befuddled, childish, senile, or playing stupid. Jisaboke (\u6642\u5dee\u30dc\u30b1)(literally, \"time difference fog\") is the term for jet lag. Nebokeru (\u5bdd\u307c\u3051\u308b) is a verb denoting the actions or condition of someone who is half-asleep, or nodding off. Tobokeru means playing dumb, and toboketa kao refers to a poker face. The related term bokashi (\u6688\u304b\u3057) means intentional blurring or gradation; that is a noun form of the transitive verb bokasu \u6688\u3059 which means to make something blurry, rather than to be blurry.\n\n*source : wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh)\n\n[01-02-15]\nPart of the promo for a pack created and sold on Envato \nhttps://videohive.net/item/soft-bokeh-background-pack-1/10231859\n\n[28-08-21]\nMinting this 1:1 | 640x640 | 449 FRAMES | 360FPS\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSwXskbArZfAZo9ViW9XtBBJeMMXJCUEkH8mXEyTWM6PN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSwXskbArZfAZo9ViW9XtBBJeMMXJCUEkH8mXEyTWM6PN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSwXskbArZfAZo9ViW9XtBBJeMMXJCUEkH8mXEyTWM6PN", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["bokeh", "soft", "pleasing", "relaxing", "anxietyrelief", "relax", "meditation", "animation", "loop", "seamless", "slow"], "extra": {}}
