I went to the field I usually go through to get to my picnic spot and noticed these thistles. Usually I'd walk past and ignore them but I decided to take a bunch of photos. I thought of ways to use them with the audio I worked on a day before. The thistles are what you see briefly between the sections. \nI recorded three slow motion videos, two of which were on this same walk: walking through a little path, and a small horizontal branch laying on the floor. The third video was taken while I was on the train, this is what you see whilst the text is displayed.\nThe words WORN, TORN, HURT, LOST and FAKE are shown throughout and are personal as I find myself feeling these..\nThe imagery of the crosses and circles represent, to me, feeling off-target, lost. There's always a constant fog internally and I feel I never see completely clearly.\n\nAlex Radomski | Site: alexradomski.com | Twitter: @radomski_alex | Instagram: @alexradomski", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSpg9Lvp6M4J3V3h8FecAnsBvLQYTAeyHqK2vdtoanPZD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVBH7MhzvVMZDx37XgP1YsEFHrrB6ZXWX7Y8yhYM73pgK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSpg9Lvp6M4J3V3h8FecAnsBvLQYTAeyHqK2vdtoanPZD", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bJwj5KBMc3UFk3ijykA9c1sGDmw4FEy24"], "tags": ["audio", "photography", "processing", "generative"], "extra": {}}
