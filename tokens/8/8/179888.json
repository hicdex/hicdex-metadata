I was attempting to create from my own imagination how Epicurus would have visually interpreted the atom symbol. Trough his democritean studies, Epicurus held that the elementary constituents of nature are undifferentiated matter, in the form of discrete, solid and indivisible particles (\u201catoms\u201d) below the threshold of perception, plus empty space, that is, the complement of matter or where matter is not. Ancient greeks hypothesised the existence of the atom a long time before the idea that everything is made of atoms was pioneered by John Dalton (1766-1844) in a book he published in 1808.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdeANrWCmRMKhpxYf86qiNzprZLsfBUfL5H1U5aYHdwhU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdeANrWCmRMKhpxYf86qiNzprZLsfBUfL5H1U5aYHdwhU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdeANrWCmRMKhpxYf86qiNzprZLsfBUfL5H1U5aYHdwhU", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["atom", "indivisible", "epicurus", "philosophy", "science", "democrite", "johndalton", "reality", "materialism"], "extra": {}}
