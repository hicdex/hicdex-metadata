HEN200\n\nCousins Prototype #6 is the product of seed 200 in the current \"Cousins\" procedural illustration tool. Every Cousins Prototype purchase funds developing and sharing new procedural illustration works, techniques and tools.\n\nCousins is the first procedural character project on Tezos or Ethereum (that I know of) to use a branching shape grammar to produce unique and varied illustrations. I predict we're going to see a lot more of this technique in the future.\n\nPlease join me in supporting the development of procedural artwork.
