The data underlying it comes from my collaboration with Google News Lab where I got a dataset with the most popular questions asked on Google about cats and dogs that start with the word \"Why\", such as \"Why do cats purr?\".\n\nI deconstructed all the \u00b12000 questions into their separate word (groups) to understand what types of questions are most popular. This so-called circle pack visual uses that deconstructed data, where each (deepest) circle represents a word. Although I felt it didn't display the data clearly, I did really like the pure visual appeal.\n\nBy @nadiehbremer", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZRWJ6uFmYEaJDNGVaupb79iNNUECCxKdZhgdmbK4F4Cr", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb9LNEvbedLMmmSzA9CS3nZc9iYvtjtyHisjxioveM2x1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZRWJ6uFmYEaJDNGVaupb79iNNUECCxKdZhgdmbK4F4Cr", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UPfsrzqrJ2DrYnZdrVsjBohtxxyQ8fK2e"], "tags": ["datavisualization", "dataviz", "dataart", "visualcinnamon", "circles"], "extra": {}}
