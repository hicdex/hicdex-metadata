I imagined s/he was just like that, feline, but I didn't know s/he smoked pot either. The God of the Internet was sick and had an immense difficulty in assuming his/her own behavior. S/he was the one who released the photo of my threesome with Liberty and the Redeemer. S/he insists it was the dog, but I know the Cat very well. I lived in his/her castle, isolated in a Cryptovoxels space, for many days, or months, or years... I'm not quite sure of the time, but I know that there were at least 12500 joints. As sick as the Cat is and as much as s/he has imprisoned me to pet him/her, I still like him/her a lot and supply him/her monthly with marijuana; nevertheless, I still don't know if s/he is a boy or a girl.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVdZgKDt5vWM1oqxRBBtjsALP1NYetXjHeNyaCdMe7ksz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfYCTmKJ5268kMSbae2xCGa78eoKsdbZgHp7CHf4fhfad", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVdZgKDt5vWM1oqxRBBtjsALP1NYetXjHeNyaCdMe7ksz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhZnNDbg5XyurR2rPB7eNwZuAf4Jow6XJ"], "tags": ["CryptoDealer", "Story", "Weed", "NFTStory", "DigitalArt"], "extra": {}}
