You can find very large and small animals, and wonderful birds there. Sometimes you can meet predatory plants also, so please be careful. \nAnd it\u2019s also interesting that in the womb of the planet, inside its heart, there is a mineral called kreo. It, as a life-giving force, connects all the inhabitants of the planet. This mineral shines through their eyes, colors their skin, flows in their blood.\n\nIn this illustration, you can see petilaxes - very large animals, inhabitants of the desert, which are approached by alteons - somewhat similar to birds.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZgLcnGojiiZvtaUvGUYsh4XdSFkFxNhng6P7vKtXbDr3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmasy8RiW8fNWBmk5ye8Kr1Y3orn4Zna7fduBjeDmYsXAs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZgLcnGojiiZvtaUvGUYsh4XdSFkFxNhng6P7vKtXbDr3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1X1d5hFHoH9oHJFUiudZzoXzV3pVAWyTiy"], "tags": ["illustration", "conceptart", "2dart", "space", "planet", "storytelling"], "extra": {}}
