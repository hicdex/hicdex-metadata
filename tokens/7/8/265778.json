We offered to buy them outright for $50, but the seller said she\u2019d see what she got. We ended up winning the bid for $1. When we arrived it was a slightly bemused old man, who\u2019d presume-ably had people arrive to cart off his things all day. He was moving to a care facility and his daughter was selling his things in preparation. It was this chest of drawers and mirror, and a matching bed head and side tables. It felt strange ransacking this old man\u2019s room. I can only imagine what he was thinking as he watched us pile it precariously into a cage trailer already full of second hand furniture. We had only hired for the half day, we were worse than broke, so a $1 bedroom set was right in our budget.\n\nBut in the end it felt right. He told us he\u2019d had them for fifty years, and was clearly proud of them, with their wood panel vinyl, rattan face and working radio. We told him how much we loved the style, that we\u2019d take good care of the set, and we hoped they\u2019d get another fifty years of good use. I\u2019d like to think he felt good, knowing the furniture that he and his wife\u2019s beloved bed set would form the centre piece of another young couple\u2019s room and life. \n\nWe gave him twenty dollars, which he took uncertainly. We didn\u2019t see his wife in anything but photos on the wall.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidafbpfl3phmnq3ik3aau3xgjktgodmtbjzn2w366hcx6n6kbg2by", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreihhpgcuoilgw6skhtpvingtzdpzuwnx46syyfifugyi453i2g2yc4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidafbpfl3phmnq3ik3aau3xgjktgodmtbjzn2w366hcx6n6kbg2by", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1WcfbCgmvtt1ViHZep84jZD7b9f7gSxiP9"], "tags": ["Seenonsunday", "sketch", "lifesketch", ""], "extra": {}}
