This highly poisonous Coral snake was found in my backyard here in South Texas.  He measured 44\" long and is the longest coral snake that I have ever seen. Snakes rarely attack humans unless bothered, and we feel it is best to let them be, as nature intended.  However, my dog gets really inquisitive, so to protect him, we had to capture and transport the snake to an area where we could both be safe.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigsacvc55ukfgi6vhlukcrwbpgxcy2zsihkycfivlns356ue2eluu", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiffvlcbutgsoauldthjd246tkjlio7huj5gni2qahvu4wkv753juq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigsacvc55ukfgi6vhlukcrwbpgxcy2zsihkycfivlns356ue2eluu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["snake", "nature", "naturalist", "texas", "poison", "photo", "wild", ""], "extra": {}}
