Conventional paintings always puzzle me. Is that all the artist sees when looking at a scene, a subject? No thoughts, no associations, no metaphors, no ideas? Everything I see is dense with meaning, a network of many nodes. I try to convey that feeling in my work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeih2er3a677wnk7sbc4fn3kawuzxoymcxyus7d6rnl5yrd5hoqvxm4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeieafmqbdhkpmmsusjnugmo3r23ep5tqjs4tzholmw2rkvyk34bdmy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeih2er3a677wnk7sbc4fn3kawuzxoymcxyus7d6rnl5yrd5hoqvxm4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1crkfaAVgywB71aNXhPCJo3i1hrZCHNr61"], "tags": ["ai", "cryptoart", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
