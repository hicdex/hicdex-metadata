hour when I just want to \nsmoke my cigar\nafter two cans of beer\nafter a day of calls with stupid people\nwith just a few\nsecretly agreeing with me\nafter a day of \ngrasping for air from underwater\nfrom the underground train\nwith all the screaming children\nand laughing spoiled children\nwe earned this\nwe spoiled children generation\nwith our houses\nwith our thirty years mortgages\nwith our cars\nwith our two weeks yearly vacation\nwith our papers on the wall\nwhat have we earned after all\nwouldn't have been better\nto fight some war\nand maybe die\nand maybe live\nwho knows\nat least we'd had some purpose\nand not this industrial cut\npurpose\nkeeping on consuming\nconsuming this fake purpose\nbuying clothes\nbuying cheap food\nbuying everything until\nwe're satisfied\nbarely capable of enjoying sex\nwith our girlfriend\ncan we even put an end to all of this\ncan we even grasp for air\nthough sometimes I've gone too\nat 2 am\nto some place I don't even remember\nwhat if\nwe suddenly lose our jobs\nhouses\ncars\nrelatives\nwould it be really that uncomfortable\nthat much more uncomfortable, at all?\nwould society lock us in some hospital\npoint at us with her finger and laugh\nor maybe she would see\nshe was wrong all along\nand join us\nor maybe after all\nwe're really nothing but\nspoiled children of peace and \nparent's money\npatiently waiting\nfor our children's children\nto throw some bombs at us\n\ncan't we see what's wrong\ncan't we see what's right\nbut everything is wrong\nand everything is right\nwe can't even fight our own battles\nanymore\nwe just want some quiet place\nwhere we can laugh at the occasional\npolitician with ideas we think are wrong\nwhile we enjoy a nice but simple meal\nwhile poisons in the air and in the soil\nin our minds\nslowly kill us\nwhile we know that\nbut we can't really throw a punch \nat an enemy so tiny\nour war is really\nmore refined\ncompared to our grandfather's ones\nmy grandfather used to tell me\nabout them \nabout how he used to laugh\nin front of death\nand yes this I can still do\nlook at this full moon\nat this tiny cars \nrunning fast\nand laugh\n\nmeanwhile I reach\nfor something I can reach\na car\na house\na way everyone goes through\na job\nbecause it's so much harder\nto carve my own\nand I'll keep saying \nin five years I'll have saved enough\nin ten years I'll have saved enough\nin fifty years\nI'll have saved enough to buy my own grave\nwhile rich people are there\nreally laughing\nreally enjoying the show\nreally thanking their parents\nfor\nexploitation, murders, wars\nbut we all always think\nsomeone is laughing harder than us\nwhile probably\nno one is laughing at all\nand our children's children\nwill have their final bitter laugh\nwhen they finally will grow strong enough\nto chase us with their guns \n\nbut let me stop\nI've had enough complaining\nlet's wrap this cigar up\nand stroke my dick ritually\nimagining some exotic girl\nimagining you're here with me\nand not away chasing your dreams\ncompletely futile like mine are\nbut somehow\nwe're very good at making\na big deal out of them\n\nI really want to see\nthe dawn of a new day\nbut deep down I know\nthat dawn is soaked with blood\nand I don't know if after\na lifetime of peace\nI want to broke my glasses \nin some foreign land\n\nwill we really be able not to say\n\"I'm sorry\"\nbefore raping our enemy's daughters?\n\nmeanwhile we're here trying to communicate\nwho knows what\nthrough some forced artistic hoops\nor searching meaning\nin some contrived book\nor trashy tv show\nor just binge watching\nour favorite series\nepisode by episode\nknowing we don't really like it that much\nor at all\nbut it keeps us going\nso we go\nfeeling feelings\nthinking thoughts\nthat aren't our own\nand when we see our friends\nwe just talk of what has happened\nwithout any interest at all\n\nis this the real life\nor is just fantasy someone would ask\nwe still have to find an answer to this question\nbut it doesn't seem like\nwe're searching very hard\nit really takes a good poker face\nto act like we despise\nsuicide\nand if we meet\nI'll be the first one to try\nto talk you out of it\nbecause I never really tell\nmyself not to do it\nbecause I really just avoid\nthis confrontation\nand I keep hoping for the day\nI find my meaning\n\nyet somehow I forget I've found it\nin that face you make that\nonly we find funny\nlike all I've wrote today\nis just an ugly joke\n\nand then we laugh\n",
