There isn't much symbolism going on here besides it being a common piece portrayed in the tattoo world which I used to be part of, and where I started as an artist before making Brave Art. Before making Tattoo Designs I was illustrating flowers, hence the rose, overall is a more personal piece that I'm giving out to the community as a thank you token for taking me in so warmly. \n\nMore technical aspects, original handmade piece was drawn on 50% recycled coffee cups A4 paper cut by me, using Sakura Micron Pens, 0.4 and 0.1. The color is set as a dimed yellow overlaid on a TrueGrit Texture of paper in order of mimicking a gold engraving on black textured paper.
