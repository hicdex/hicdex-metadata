The story tells of a woman who, after getting married, decided to use the niqab. But day by day, one by one, the parts of the woman's face are gone. The surreal story of a woman who lost her nose and then other parts of her face gradually. This story represents how the hijab as a religious symbol controlled by the hegemony of specific values \u200b\u200bprevents women from having absolute power over their bodies.\n\nFrom the fictional story, I photographed the three stages of the transformation. This work is made in two series, black and white, to represent how people perceive women with hijab. There is black and white, good and bad, sinful and innocent.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihfqjzmmrrbznsevm433jtzxizov4grpn53x5d5xbnlpsepclkahe", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihfqjzmmrrbznsevm433jtzxizov4grpn53x5d5xbnlpsepclkahe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihfqjzmmrrbznsevm433jtzxizov4grpn53x5d5xbnlpsepclkahe", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1PQ5CvYAqxJLSdfYWznazhPtV27fQWdB8R"], "tags": ["arumdayu", "photography", "contemporary", "hijab", "fashion", "visualart"], "extra": {}}
