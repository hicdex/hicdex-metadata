The Buoys also measure wave heights.You can see Deal Pier just off the left of the painting in the centre.\n\nEver since the Egyptians lit the first beacons to warn mariners of rocks, navigational aids have been keeping mariners safe over the centuries.\n\nJMW Turner also painted these buoys, they are often the one red dot he famously put in his sea paintings. I live and paint the same glorious seas and skies that Turner painted in the 19C.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZgnv7Rx3S17ZnzmmpKbJoYYcq5MLjtiBYvmeEsBECuFk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTUTviy2ZR21Q8jwiqTGpJPYsTZR3VyVyvzaMQyVYCQ6i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZgnv7Rx3S17ZnzmmpKbJoYYcq5MLjtiBYvmeEsBECuFk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Turner", "StephanieFuller", "watercolor", "seascape", "WaveBuoy", "DealKent"], "extra": {}}
