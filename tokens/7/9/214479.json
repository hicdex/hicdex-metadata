It's a gesture based work followed with long meditative transformations. Like releasing light in darkness.\nDragon No2 is an animalistic sexual struggle with my unconscious anxieties and fears during the Pandemic.  It's like making a Rorschach blot and discovering the meaning of it at the same time.\nMy mission is to show that we need to embrace our dark side to be able to free our mind from negative thoughts which are causing suffering. These paintings are meditations. They can reflect our subconscious thoughts and feelings and bring them to the light. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRsHup9msccv9BwcKp4oR7WETbkqwPfYwC9fr1aLfjke", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdGpcqPGBdi66Ziqu49Cd2YQKvfyPBVoQ12CV3XGzaWU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRsHup9msccv9BwcKp4oR7WETbkqwPfYwC9fr1aLfjke", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L1rdDzjGNx5B6SSfRGiWvTmi94FH4XVSP"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
