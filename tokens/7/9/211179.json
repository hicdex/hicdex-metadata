Hard liquor and fist fighting forever!\n\nScratchnasty, an AI warbot of indeterminate antiquity, is controlled by Mother Knuckle through eldritch communion with his machine spirit. However, Scratchnasty\u2019s crew-  the clandestine goblin freedom fighters known only as Golf Lima Foxtrot - have sworn a pact with the sly old witch to steal Clawhammer's killswitch from about Captain Panik\u2019s neck, a trinket that- while it is in his position- cements his ascendancy over her. Should the plot ever succeed, the GLO could escape into the scablands and live free as nomads, whilst back on Turtle Rock the Ol\u2019 Crow Crew would see a change of management.\nScratchbuilt model, photographed and altered digitally, one of a series with interlocking narratives. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXaqNbuMK7F4RGYVeMKPj1JYjzSczPbY8EZCzbKiwdmsU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXaqNbuMK7F4RGYVeMKPj1JYjzSczPbY8EZCzbKiwdmsU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXaqNbuMK7F4RGYVeMKPj1JYjzSczPbY8EZCzbKiwdmsU", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SmgSukHrJR9JsqiMUibLXgsNCAFeXAehM"], "tags": ["OlCrowCrew", "collectible", "scifi", "robot"], "extra": {}}
