Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, born into the royal family of Kapurthala and educated in Edwardian England, decided her life\u2019s mission was to help India break free from its colonial ties and oppressive societal norms. Before long, she was tackling social issues, pushing for women\u2019s education and the right to vote and to divorce, and speaking out against child marriage. She became a secretary to Gandhi in 1930. In leaving her life of luxury, Kaur not only helped build lasting democratic institutions, she also inspired generations to fight for the marginalized.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYpMLwmYHmjV4PNSDJnLMuZCJ2eyXuanMAbNpSH3Mb86p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUVX5siSHFhN1j58TEEirwYE5xgZ67wgGX3eDaiNxbeQp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYpMLwmYHmjV4PNSDJnLMuZCJ2eyXuanMAbNpSH3Mb86p", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
