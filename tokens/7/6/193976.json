The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf5vxmKdn4gosjWs1AfdZqEfZjnRdqFCGUBBjMJkYngyg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYBMGD1zW2HWtsmQy6T6Q9HhCMW1VUgCvZ5oNCmskUBcz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf5vxmKdn4gosjWs1AfdZqEfZjnRdqFCGUBBjMJkYngyg", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PaqzE2Rnr7B9K5DrNWJ3ZEYi9eLjCW2Rm"], "tags": ["planet", "sun", "3d", "art", ""], "extra": {}}
