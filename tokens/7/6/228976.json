This photograph is from a series entitled \u201cFor Want of Clearer Light\u201d by painter and photographer Matthew Linden King.  The photo is created using in-camera multiple exposures, a series of backlit stencils, and various light sources.  Created in a darkened environment, this series explores ideas of darkness and light, known and unknown, certainty and uncertainty, and seeks to understand how ideas of opacity and transparency can manifest themselves through the medium of light.  This image was created directly in the camera, with the only edits being cropping and minor color adjustments.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQxu5JjL3PNTNigEu2mkx1iE7yTekzCmhnzTWxcLWGmQZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPXhfn68YMPbmwavqhVdegBc7EC4hudzfpQhS7PD8S6bU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQxu5JjL3PNTNigEu2mkx1iE7yTekzCmhnzTWxcLWGmQZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WwzQY2tZJAZMp3Pt4DQdHuRJSzZ3qxd3X"], "tags": ["photograph", "photography", "digital", "abstract", "design"], "extra": {}}
