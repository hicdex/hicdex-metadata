Please Stand By, Pardoning the Martinsville 7. Last week, 70 years after 7 black men were executed in the state of Virginia for the rape of a white woman, the governor of Virginia pardoned them, claiming they were denied due process because of their race. Having been tried by an all white jury, coerced into signing confessions they could not read, and sentenced to death for a crime in which no white man in the state has ever been sentenced to death for, the governor stated, \u201cthese men were executed because they were Black, and that\u2019s not right.\u201d While he wouldn\u2019t go as far as to clear their guilty verdict, he did admit that they were never provided a fair and just trial, something that had been afforded to the many white men accused of the same crime over the years. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction towards racial equity in the justice system.
