{"__version": 1, "token_id": 269376, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "0", "description": "Tabula rasa (/\u02c8t\u00e6bj\u0259l\u0259 \u02c8r\u0251\u02d0s\u0259, -z\u0259, \u02c8re\u026a-/; \"blank slate\") is the theory that individuals are born without built-in mental content, and therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception. Epistemological proponents of tabula rasa disagree with the doctrine of innatism, which holds that the mind is born already in possession of certain knowledge. Proponents of the tabula rasa theory also favour the \"nurture\" side of the nature versus nurture debate when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, knowledge, and sapience.\n\n______________\n\nIMG: 1560 x 1560 350 dpi\nSony A7s 35mm", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicv25263nnuwb74cfta5ruckvdiffcnnf4ozlt5nqvjwpyzas6t7u", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicnmjtb5at2seyac2bwzi23r6p3fzxiqujnykn2w6mfzwszesft2e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicv25263nnuwb74cfta5ruckvdiffcnnf4ozlt5nqvjwpyzas6t7u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Tzy4MkerHBjs47YCarWfwhTV8RpDbukdg"], "tags": ["nftartist", "tezos", "nftart", "eyes", "psychedelicart", "hicetnunc2000", "nftcollection", "tezosart", "soul", "cryptoart", "nft", "tabularasa", "portraits", "hicetnunc", "nftphotography"], "extra": {}}
