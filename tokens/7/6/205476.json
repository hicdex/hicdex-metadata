Some Thing got him. Now, he\u2019s come home, and Jason is back on the hunt for promiscuous college kids partying like those counselors that let him drown all those years ago. It almost seems like another lifetime.\n\nThe Thing likes this new form. It doesn\u2019t have to hide in its human suit, playing dumb and waiting for the dark. This version, this very peculiar human-like human that it has assimilated is fearless, shameless, and perversely honest in its single-minded drive to maim, torture, and kill. This is the most fun it\u2019s had yet on this planet full of squishy, screaming meat.\n\n2048x2728 pixel PNG\n\nA mash-up of two classic horror movie monsters: Jason from the Friday the 13th movies and the spider head creature from John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing.\n\nMinted for #FEAR4HEN celebration of Friday, August 13th, 2021.\n\nVerify via Twitter account @tormential and/or Instagram account @_tormential_ and/or tormential.tez\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWjij2y1AHqdsTbD4TnKY9BuH128huTLFjzW7Rc5LfDFt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRLRseDwRYFk5TfyE9mt3qZa2fsvsLqResvVxPaxRK24L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWjij2y1AHqdsTbD4TnKY9BuH128huTLFjzW7Rc5LfDFt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NRryWFv9qoxQPPWkUE6ChpD6uZhUG2r3d"], "tags": ["FEAR4HEN", "JASON", "JASONVOORHEES", "THETHING", "DARKART", "SPIDER", "TORMENTIAL", "HORROR", "MACHETE", "AXE"], "extra": {}}
