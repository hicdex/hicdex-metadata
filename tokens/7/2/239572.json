(Water-Air-Earth-Fire) One of the triangles represents the positive aspects of life and the other triangle represents the negative aspects. (Contrasts)\n\nIt has also been used as a motif on various objects, as the belief that the devil cannot enter the place is dominant. The stigma of THE Suleiman is a symbol of spiritual protection as well as statehood and domination.\n\nWhoever has the stigma is Suleiman.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbQQmxroZRaLPnqE12S9dxqCkJrPNaJ2T6x4oShvvuuiG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQvpfqmJ4qZnYrb3RmgZ3S3A8NT895GZHcnhy664i6fdE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbQQmxroZRaLPnqE12S9dxqCkJrPNaJ2T6x4oShvvuuiG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1W4YSwG95sku3JdFQKjUnJLzzBJia56URn"], "tags": ["4elements", "ring", "air", "water", "air", "earth"], "extra": {}}
