Once we got to talking, he offered to take me up to the 49th floor of the building, where the restaurant he worked in was at.\nHe showed me the view of the city from all four sides of the building. He said he appreciated the kinds of photos I was taking. Documenting people and their normal lives. We just talked about any and everything in the time I spent up in the restaurant.\nAs I left, I explained to him that I was planning on proposing to my wife (then girlfriend) and he offered to get us in for a dinner, in a private section, and completely take care of it. \nWe kept in contact in the time leading up to our dinner, and it was amazing. Dinner overlooking the city as we took the first step into starting a life together. We will never forget him. He is an amazing man.\n\nWilliam. 2018.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibghve6jsiaovevo6kgq3bnm55bpridewsmatipcyw5wz6ahm3rgq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiafedhn6roj5m44eusbvh4qcbty46xy67erzw6cfoqis2aoq5ukyu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeibghve6jsiaovevo6kgq3bnm55bpridewsmatipcyw5wz6ahm3rgq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
