Heinlein\nT Alto Cruz 35\n8016-104 TWYdxceD\nFavorite color:Silver\n\nI've lived in the parallel universe for 20 years now and I love it. It's beautiful. The universe you live in would normally be a boring place. There are people you know, neighbors come and go. You work, you play, you fall in love. You start a family, have children, and raise them on your own. You will have a life and accomplish something. But you will not do any of those things. Instead, you live in this ever-changing world.\nThe world I have lived in has been the most exciting world I have known. I could have lived anywhere. I am fortunate to live in a place where things move quickly. It's like flying in the sky. There is a lot more freedom. People are younger, richer, more interesting, and more diverse than in the normal universe. It is a place where people do things they cannot do in the normal universe.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmamkCBmawTa5rzn5YmauK4oGEE5NEvrNeoNMudmxupiCn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWLDE9pw27vZKCFfksw39bKC6xsQTmQPw9DaqKEidxRgS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmamkCBmawTa5rzn5YmauK4oGEE5NEvrNeoNMudmxupiCn", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2DurpCmTtZp7YPHmP2hPyonZ3G6VMxqWSQ"], "tags": ["Mixed-media", "portrait", "series", ""], "extra": {}}
