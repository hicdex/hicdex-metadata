The past days has really been tiring even if I'm just sitting in front of my laptop. Work is piling up. I'm slowly getting tired socialising even if I need it. Anxiety takes over, making me overwhelmed and troubled to start working. But despite these challenges, good things still happen. And I am still thankful.

Get back when you can. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQyF94T47QzBs93bAU8muHXqAiKnxFXfUJ1utzJGUXAtV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZw9fYKKbuDQCCXRFwZbeCaHCiKeW5cJ4J6nfv51zSJfv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQyF94T47QzBs93bAU8muHXqAiKnxFXfUJ1utzJGUXAtV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dbE17AsMNpkR6Ste5z2QNsx8XfG3JBELL"], "tags": ["Contemporaryart", "psychedelicart", "psychedelic", "cryptoartph", "jarrettcross", "science", "surrealism", "journalofjarrettcross", "journal", "performance", "diary", "gan", "generativeadversarialnetwork", "deeplearning", "artificialintelligence", "ai"], "extra": {}}
