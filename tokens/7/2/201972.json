During the decades that followed, these grew into a small family forest.\n\nFrom 2017 on, extended drought weakened the trees. Mild winters aided the explosion of numbers of Ips typographus (the Spruce Bark Beetle) all over Europe. The forest died, and was cleared in September 2019. Since then, the land is The Plot, a central component of my artistic doctoral research into dealing with ecological grief. \n\nThe Plot is mapped, documented, used as a meeting point, and being prepared for regeneration.
