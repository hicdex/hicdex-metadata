It was just required to photograph it from every possible direction. After some editing, these characters just came to life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPnYNnTRkhqi2i7dBemv4DyGQwDQkX299MfXGF8RKXsLm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRAhvv3eWue7H252cEGfhJxdAnSnJbcgWPfDuQrpRP2LE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPnYNnTRkhqi2i7dBemv4DyGQwDQkX299MfXGF8RKXsLm", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZuXpzkdPKxGupK5CFM1zHPDtGh1PD9BKK"], "tags": ["Pillow", "Sofa", "Leather", "Digitalart", "Photography", "Fineart", "creatures", "madness", "Darkness"], "extra": {}}
