Palm oil and pulp for paper are flooding global markets from Sumatra, the world\u2019s sixth largest island.\n\nSumatra lost forest at an average rate of 0.46 million hectares per year (1.8%). With the devastating deforestation rate, animals are loosing home and prey, in the brink of extinction.\n\nSAVE initiative - 70% Part of this OBJKT sales will go to WWF INDONESIA to help the conservation effort of the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sondaica). There are less than 400 of these majestic creatures are left in the world.\nStand with Me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3R2woNwqAqWwnkKWL8WFKE1bQY6q7RUwCzcbnNhUcZx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfBKe744Q8BEZpvsRG4Vyd55KJSmieHvgcUwk3X5R5CvR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ3R2woNwqAqWwnkKWL8WFKE1bQY6q7RUwCzcbnNhUcZx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ftYUEJkHvxp5a1Uwph7MSj9w95uc7nJPF"], "tags": ["AI", "CG", "3d", "wildlife", "fauna", "save", "forest", "tiger", "sumatera"], "extra": {}}
