An outspoken suffragist and feminist, she tirelessly led the charge for women's suffrage and equal rights in the United States. Alice Paul advocated for and helped secure passage of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution, granting women the right to vote. Paul next authored the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923, which has yet to be adopted.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmejvZpVLn8HC4fV6wdUivVFmKWewpw5hf1e7Frxne5Dbc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcD7GTbFjoBoSFx9mtuVdwEXomXdxb2dXJXurZMkAZo7a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmejvZpVLn8HC4fV6wdUivVFmKWewpw5hf1e7Frxne5Dbc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
