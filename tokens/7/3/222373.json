Your favorite velociraptor is running so fast that he has to secure his baseball cap with a string. \n\nFYI: Warm oatmeal pancakes taste better than lukewarm oatmeal pancakes and lukewarm oatmeal pancakes taste better than cold ones. \n\nThe scene depicted, is closely related to a happening in my upcoming book titled \"Hypersensitivosaurus and Cold Turkey\" where the former visits the latter after an unfortunate incident.\n\nAside from writing this book, I am also illustrating it and I will be including process art and little anecdotes too. This particular drawing will be uniquely owned by you though. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma9DefG7KcMty4za8BHUsA6k6jEiwCna2K7YzR8aDAGFW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVYP25YqmNtNeeLHg7eegYXjeBUBQdivM1pSMo6SH3PCi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma9DefG7KcMty4za8BHUsA6k6jEiwCna2K7YzR8aDAGFW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aa9PoZthm6yGFu8EPDaWDX3oc1XWu8oGq"], "tags": ["pencilart", "coloringpencilonpaper", "hypersensitivosaurus", "hypersensitivosaurusandcoldturkey"], "extra": {}}
