{"__version": 1, "token_id": 230371, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Technical Fabric Sculpture #1 ", "description": "Technical Fabric sculptures are a mix of analog and digital processes with Virtual Reality abstract drawing. I bring a reference of a video still into the VR program Gravity Sketch and use the reference to add lines and shapes to enhance/bring to life the original rescan. All reference images were made with video hardware/mixers with internal video feedback and rescanned off a CRT monitor with a digital camera. The Stills and Virtual Reality drawings are united together in Photoshop. \n\n3360 x 2100 pixels ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVvSyyAtvRnixXym7QtsSJ6pce6WicGTQep3U8TEsyvfD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPCrMrD7Xu87m1YSzzF7aFfEx7tXBd4AnPGhCufiQt4ZE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVvSyyAtvRnixXym7QtsSJ6pce6WicGTQep3U8TEsyvfD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UiA3Nkg2Ugy2BPqorU7V5LPwCukK5wZd3"], "tags": ["vr", "virtualreality", "mixedmedia", "videofeedback", "videohardware", "feedbackloop", "vrdrawing", "vrpainting", "sculpture"], "extra": {}}
