The first exercise was to design a functional object of art, which would fulfill the function of an ashtray or a vase, made with pigmented eco-friendly cement.\n\nThe second exercise: generate a habitat for it, in the plane where it has been gestated. I have titled it \"Mental Caverns\" thinking that every physical product, firstly, manifests on the mental plane, and then on the digital plane, before a f\u00edsical plane.\n\nIn that subtle space, which could be considered or interpreted as a cave, the modeling, the piece is not alone. There are several objects that surround the moment; there are various situations, events, emotions, etc. that accompany the gestation / materialization process of each final product.\n\nI have included an experiment, a sound piece, created with basic knowledge in Ableton Live.\n(Nothing technical)\n\nI hope you enjoy it and that this is the beginning of a long story in this digital universe.\n\nPeace", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSSjPUBuiFFgbc5Tfq9bjp2gGgrguHbaeHtGfj1CTEsep", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTwYJe4dCPq8ASaJaTeLUdrfko4g9oafTAohh5XrkWqCx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmSSjPUBuiFFgbc5Tfq9bjp2gGgrguHbaeHtGfj1CTEsep"}], "creators": ["tz1MgkWfkV24So7iQp7TGQXDWqhvXzHd6YNf"], "tags": ["3Dmodeling", "3Ddesign", "3Danimation", "Imagination"], "extra": {}}
