As the name of the song sugest, Self-Isolation is a melancholic song fitted for some of us that still suffer from social distance since the covid. Perfect for listening indoor during rainy days.\n \nThe process of creation and production was minimalist done, only with a laptop, a headset and a lot of research on musical theory. Inspired by the DIY culture, \"Furniture Songs\" shows that virtually anyone can create their sounds without the need for expensive and specific equipment and hard work.\n\nTrack: 3 of 6\nGenres: Chill-Out, Ambient, Lo-Fi\nMaster: Rodrigo Paschoal\nRelease Date: Apr 30, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYoRpvUD2pcaKWes2gmywdwZNvbkTimfjQyMg3p2uBU5x", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVisQdb3hL8TUWFnHZY7VBedGH6nv1d3EzmqUf1CMsJFu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYoRpvUD2pcaKWes2gmywdwZNvbkTimfjQyMg3p2uBU5x", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MM2wfCrRzGvXYTt1BsChqsACaF5SJQiVN"], "tags": ["music", "lofi", "chill-out", "sad"], "extra": {}}
