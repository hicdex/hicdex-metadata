The algorithm, coded in Processing language, uses the hash of a block to map the block into a deterministic representation tokenized as an NFT (read more at bit.ly/coilgrams).  This is the very first Coilgram minted on a different blockchain than Ethereum. \n\nThe Coilgram is essentially based on the idea of perturbing a spiral with Perlin noise and then repeating the task many times. In this sense, Greek Pi is a crucial number for this artwork. For such a reason, I decided to mint 314 editions each listed for 3.14 XTZ.
