{"__version": 1, "token_id": 231371, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "DEVAST - 005 (Evilmon)", "description": "DEVAST is summoned when a human being or animal dies of EVIL craveness in a wasteland. EVIL coin generates greed and the thirst for money. This also applies to animals. Once that greed becomes too big to handle, death occurs and the EVIL creates a DEVAST.\n\nMultiple EVIL can cause multiple DEVAST summoned at once.\n\nDEVAST is not considered as a living creature. Some rich or EVIL collectors like to hold DEVAST on their walls as props or EVIL hunt prizes.\n\nDEVAST can sometimes be worn as a mask. Greater level EVILMONs often transform every living being around them into DEVAST, making them very dangerous to get close to. \n\nDEVAST has been airsummoned to every wallet that owned any OBJKT from CMXIVVII on Tuesday, 24th of August, 2021\n\nDEVAST is a level I EVILMON.\nDEVAST can evolve.\n\nDEVAST art has been made by CMXIVVII\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cumix47\nhen.link/CMXIVVII", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWk3Cfs1o9xv8Z9XhjifYu43DGezmfMi8Q2de6hVtCRD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSk8qJPJzcnDXLgDoPkcoU3tEGADHKyDRcH88XLNFmwA8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWk3Cfs1o9xv8Z9XhjifYu43DGezmfMi8Q2de6hVtCRD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PqenEvxbuf7pnxpeBZaUTbpE4Fexjco9Z"], "tags": ["devast", "devastation", "evil", "evilmon", "level1", "airdrop"], "extra": {}}
