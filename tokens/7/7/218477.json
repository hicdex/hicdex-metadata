Protests took place in Kabul and the Nangarhar, Khost and Kunar provinces.\nIn the city of Asadabad, Kunar province the protestors were fired upon by Taliban militants and several were killed.\nThis piece is intended as an act of solidarity with those protestors. \n\nSparkles of paint in colors of the Afghan tricolor are painted onto a white canvas. The paint is held to the dimensions of a flag.  The paint reveals the emblem and flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\nWriggling white paints attempt to turn the flag and canvas white again but they can never win and if anything they simply make the flag more vibrant and alive. \n\nCreated as an edition of 11. 10 donated to afghen and one held back, forever. This is so even if all available editions were purchased and burnt, there will always be at least one version of this flag alive on the Tezos blockchain. This is intended as a gesture of respect and memorial for those who lost their lives for the act of flying this flag.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTsRS3ciRaeKfNb8hfuWDf2ztiwXDdGVC8m13DU7yYANX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbD1GjYMegAqQTkZWGwJbiQb3A5zG3Poj13oJfZAp7PQi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbD1GjYMegAqQTkZWGwJbiQb3A5zG3Poj13oJfZAp7PQi", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTsRS3ciRaeKfNb8hfuWDf2ztiwXDdGVC8m13DU7yYANX", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1iejkdRYyq7WdVtrXgpq1dtazsGpthkF1U"], "tags": ["javascript", "p5js", "generativeart", "Afghanistan", "afghen"], "extra": {}}
