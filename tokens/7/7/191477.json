First, that identity can be verified. Second, that our online data belongs to us. Third, that reliance on memory, outsourced or not, is a good idea. And fourth, that secrets are in principle knowable and retrievable. Together, these make up a \u2018logic of the password\u2019. We can challenge such a logic, and the organisation of online experience that it underpins, by considering posthuman formulations of identity, surveillance capitalism, the infinite regress of mnemonic functions, and the unconditional, unknowable, opaque secret.\u201d\n\u2013 Clare Birchall\n\nClare Birchall is a Reader in Contemporary Culture at King's College London (UK).
