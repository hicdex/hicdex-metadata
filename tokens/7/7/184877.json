This series tells the story of my photography genesis, as this feels right to me. These animated images tell the story of my first exploration adventure, revisiting the now-abandoned theme park I used to love as a child.\n\nPart 7 of 7 // The final shots of the day are of the rollercoaster and one of the faux castles. The explore only took a few hours, the park was much smaller than I remembered. The state of abandonment of my childhood paradise left me quite sad. Although this was the start of my life exploring the abandoned world, and I am glad that my first place was here.\n\nMp4 | 1080x1080 pixels| July  2021\n\nhttps://www.obsidianurbexphotography.com/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmavmqmxPJFXtUjDzJD9zWzq7r8AQmKkeDxXzbQGJ31tp6", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma1CpjFGD7YtT7AaUJMYLFS6zzW26HBmDxrEusQPC6tiT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmavmqmxPJFXtUjDzJD9zWzq7r8AQmKkeDxXzbQGJ31tp6", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Wu77PvNTw3ZSCfnwffz6xMtMiUdFLdjm4"], "tags": ["abandoned", "urbex", "urbanexploration", "obsidianurbex", "glitch", "photography", "themepark", "janinependleton"], "extra": {}}
