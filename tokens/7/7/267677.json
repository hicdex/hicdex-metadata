Rather, e.g. Filter processes in our central nervous system to ensure that physical damage does not necessarily lead to pain (stress analgesia; e.g. injuries during a traffic accident, competition, battle or sexual intercourse are often not noticed) and, conversely, pain can persist even without physical damage (e.g. B.

In addition, the subjective perception of pain, especially in chronic pain conditions, is always shaped by cognitive and motivational influences.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeieaitjrs7ay5vxl3qisucfcfyfdhrnpt2orwdxmwkzki3xckberzu", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeide6x3m2yyqh43hsagudsyvraktazvss7aur7cv5bvl3zpmzzcjx4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeieaitjrs7ay5vxl3qisucfcfyfdhrnpt2orwdxmwkzki3xckberzu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eFKfuhFMWDHvFtGLeJMHexZ9DTBFupqa1"], "tags": ["Cinema4D", "Pain", "Character", "Female", "Voltage", "Vengence", "Vestige", "3D", "Arnold", "Arnoldrender", "CGI", "3DART", ""], "extra": {}}
