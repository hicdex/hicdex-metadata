Technique: Javascript. \u201cHuman-in-the-loop\u201d is part of \u201cI\u2019m not a robot\u201d, a series of applications exploring the murky world of digital labour and human intelligence tasks. A captcha seems like a harmless annoyance to a user, but it\u2019s a powerful and lucrative method of extracting free labour as we\u2019ve collectively been training AI for free by solving Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA puzzles for decades. To date, it\u2019s estimated that Google has extracted $7.3 billion worth of free labour using this method. Machine learning is nothing on its own: it requires millions of hours of human work to train an algorithm before its \u201cintelligence\u201d is realized. For AI to identify something as a car, it first needs humans to identify thousands of car images. The humans behind this process are known as \u201ccrowdworkers\u201d performing \u201cmicrotasks\u201d or \u201cmicrowork\u201d. Half of these online platform workers are earning less than $2 per hour, yet these micro actions have huge benefits for tech companies. \nhttps://desbiens-desmeules.com/im-not-a-robot/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRDE5qQLaJTq1C8Eby2AwW6FDP5HchSKWKXUMm97jpzEQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQkRB51WjmccqWZsyiQw6nz2BMApL7hoECAMuaCFaf3oU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQkRB51WjmccqWZsyiQw6nz2BMApL7hoECAMuaCFaf3oU", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRDE5qQLaJTq1C8Eby2AwW6FDP5HchSKWKXUMm97jpzEQ", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1Q5kA2FxYJAVV8DXrTcmFwqejc1T5iTfqb"], "tags": ["Digitallabour", "crowdworker", "clickworker", "microwork", "microtask", "Datalabeling", "digitalrights", "aitraining", "Captcha", "hit", "humanintelligencetasks", "freelabour", "playbour", "bigfour", "Bigtech", "GAFAM", "bigfive", "GAN", "artificialintelligence", "machinelearning"], "extra": {}}
