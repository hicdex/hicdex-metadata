As a child, the chimney was often a landmark for me.\nWe lived not far from the plant. When I looked out of the living room or bathroom window, I could always see it. \nIf I saw the chimney from the back seat of the car while we were driving on the motorway, I knew we would soon be home. \nI never liked this chimney, but it is a part of my life. A part of my story. As a teenager I swore that one day I would replace the chimney with a mountain view.\n20 years later, I still live in the same town and took this photo. This is not a product picture!\n\nxmvfx\n\n\ud83d\udda4\u2728\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS6Fbt3GVWqTtdbcetJbZWLZnK3DTjKKrq8gAGb1Zd7fd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSBcYG6cBMHmJyoxN1ACU2Mi1SZmzJaoqgV4iRAQFzS2T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS6Fbt3GVWqTtdbcetJbZWLZnK3DTjKKrq8gAGb1Zd7fd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TSrNvyE7efh9WiLXnMq8iWsL3VornMhdL"], "tags": ["xmvfx", "beautifulpiecesofdarkness", "thisisnotaproductpicture"], "extra": {}}
