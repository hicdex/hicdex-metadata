BLUE HAZE is a piece created out of the frustrations that come with being silenced on the internet. it's a permanent feeling of gratitude i have from any iota of likes/shares/retweets by anyone advocating for my work. you help me bend passed these invisible restrictions. by LEEAUX | WWW.LEEAUX.COM", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibetedmefar65babkmsmto7egarfpghbc2wwfwu77uajw3rpc7hja", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidusxedzhayp7pgm4gu2plsvff5rhmk4mb3rcma2ejtnoxn5qhgli", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeibetedmefar65babkmsmto7egarfpghbc2wwfwu77uajw3rpc7hja", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ecuRwDEj4hrbdtWQxk4aTbks8DmTERcF6"], "tags": ["bluehaze", "censorship", "artwork", "fine_digital", "illustration", "leeaux"], "extra": {}}
