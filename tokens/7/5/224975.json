A life comes from one single cell that continues to divide, multiply and differentiate into a variety of cells with different functions to build our body. \n\nCells then assemble into tissues, the collections of tissues form organs, variety of organs form organisms, and interactions of organisms produce life, back to one single cell as in the beginning. \n\nLife is a cycle, and the cell become a meeting point of one life cycle with the next one. \n\nThis video is a footage from my research of cells in human body that play a role to begin life. \nThe cells that have not yet differentiate into specific cells, and known as stem cells.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPWMx14CwRmpf7MX8HyHv3asKRPp9WgRxGuvBTfnMAeEq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTohQaWgvVCXnHNNEae3cnJHHAJoBn6GMfPAxjzTHbmuS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPWMx14CwRmpf7MX8HyHv3asKRPp9WgRxGuvBTfnMAeEq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cYUnaC6mPBrnMTfPsiqDyAxbgejP6ryGs"], "tags": ["cells", "microscopic", "footage", "mp4", "video", "videoart", "science", "nature", "lab"], "extra": {}}
