Every work has two versions: one is a direct representation of my polycircles system with some given parameters; the other work takes every shape (intersections among rings) and draws then arranged in a grid that grows spiralling from the center. What is the reaction, what is the perception? It's the same elements, configuring a different reality. Our lives are all lived out of the same elements, yet they are very differently perceived and lived.\n\nRead more about the origins of the collection and concept at:\n\nhttps://www.iillucid.com/polycircles-collection/\nhttps://www.iillucid.com/total-cognitive-space/\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro. 6000x3000px made with Processing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNbN9J8U3ctHX9V5CPyC7nhhhaj5u4oLsJhs5eCATuGEW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdWPgBcT7zKMAnkmYfS1xTsgRJifuj31SVCZZyuS1U4Ze", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNbN9J8U3ctHX9V5CPyC7nhhhaj5u4oLsJhs5eCATuGEW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["generative", "artxcode", "genart", "processing", "polycircles", "orphism", "iillucid."], "extra": {}}
