Causer of darkness and incalculable fears, the Celestial Jaguar is represented as a colossal creature with a bluish color and aura, a primordial being of inconceivable dimensions.\n\nIt is said that the On\u00e7a Celeste is always chasing the brothers Guaraci and Jaci (sun and moon), who pester her since the beginning of space and time, practicing various mischief against her. The merciless blue beast turns the skies into its hunting ground, snatching and tearing at Jaci \u2013 lacerations manifested in the phases of the moon. The lunar eclipse is the fatal consequence of the times the On\u00e7a Celestial manages to devour her completely, while the phenomena that invoke a reddish moonlight are Jaci's own blood. However, Guaraci always resurrects and saves his sister entity, making the moon reappear gloriously. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYsQHmSuzEjxfg2Z6Aknxh4icU15t8a6BA9ZhkqHnq54Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPkJBxtYhpGCD3STeDQM24n2NDhRqV4Z6GBFJNmviX2Z7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYsQHmSuzEjxfg2Z6Aknxh4icU15t8a6BA9ZhkqHnq54Z", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["demon", "cryptolegends", "werewolf", "curupira", "wing", "bull", "angel", "brazil", "florest", "nature", "jaguar"], "extra": {}}
