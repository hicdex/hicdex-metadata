Until the major outbreak of Dutch elm disease in the second half of the 20th century, this was a rare mushroom, but then for a decade or two its food source, rotting elm wood, became commonplace and the Rhodotus palmatus population mushroomed. Now there are far fewer elm trees in Britain and Europe, and the beautiful Rhodotus palmatus is becoming an even rarer sight that is was 100 years ago.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXFM546btPmoYpQ3UHijd3kSn5cv2bQvko6CsDNMrBTJF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXFM546btPmoYpQ3UHijd3kSn5cv2bQvko6CsDNMrBTJF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXFM546btPmoYpQ3UHijd3kSn5cv2bQvko6CsDNMrBTJF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushrooms", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
