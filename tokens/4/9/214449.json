{"__version": 1, "token_id": 214449, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "(de)constructions ii / deconstructed", "description": "a series of artworks that explore the relationships between substance and perception. Every work has two versions: one is a direct representation of my polycircles system with some given parameters; the other work takes every shape (intersections among rings) and draws then arranged in a grid that grows spiralling from the center. What is the reaction, what is the perception? It's the same elements, configuring a different reality. Our lives are all lived out of the same elements, yet they are very differently perceived and lived.\n\nThis is the companion work to objkt #214430.\n\nRead more about the origins of the collection and concept at:\n\nhttps://www.iillucid.com/polycircles-collection/\nhttps://www.iillucid.com/total-cognitive-space/\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro. 6000x3000px made with Processing.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNv93WjpNubjXjbjBKEpk1pMfS4sNEWoVobitMiVTcfTj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSx6h246Yz4SqvD3mXXXuqxd6hPRAKckxVdCiFRWEGr78", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNv93WjpNubjXjbjBKEpk1pMfS4sNEWoVobitMiVTcfTj", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["generative", "artxcode", "genart", "processing", "polycircles", "orphism", "iillucid", "generativeart"], "extra": {}}
