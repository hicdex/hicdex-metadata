Unlike Makgeolli, Domdomju is the drink of the nobles. It has a non-unified flavor and you can separately feel the sweetness, acidity, floral and citrus notes, and carbonation coming from moti rice and artisanal yeast. Made in a single bottle by The Chef and The Alchemist and branded by The Philosopher, this drink is a great gift to commemorate an important event.
