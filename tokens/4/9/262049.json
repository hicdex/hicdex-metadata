And in the corner of each of the 3D arts of this abstract collection, a verse from the lyric No. 636 of Rumi is written.\nThis poem is about the mystical concept of \"dying before dying\" which is one of the important concepts in Rumi's thought. The first \"death\" refers to the separation from all worldly belongings and carnal and human dependencies, which means entering the first stage of conduct. But the second \"death\" is real death and the end of life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidrdkg2d6inu3fpuwmno7z3tu7o2e4s7sh6ghxzesyzdpn7yeggxa", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidc4k5izox7g47uxcb5mvueedayn7whlzyzackeqalrrxsypo3cxa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidrdkg2d6inu3fpuwmno7z3tu7o2e4s7sh6ghxzesyzdpn7yeggxa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["cryptoart", "nftart", "3dart", "nfts", "nft", "rasakolko", "art", "blue", "devil", "soul", "rumi", "persian"], "extra": {}}
