I found some time to continue designing the \"TheCryptoWeirds\" collection ..\nI think that the CryptoWeirds, serve people to distract themselves from the daily routine and monotony of ordinary life .. Or maybe (more simply) they serve me to get out of this world that all in all I do not understand well ..\nI don't understand the rules of the world I live in.\nMany times life seems to me a game that I am not able to play, but only to which I adapt.\n\nAnyway .. I hope that looking at CryptoWeirds number 26 makes you want to look at the other numbers, and to try (for a few seconds) to look at the world in the same way I see it.\n\n(I remind you, the first CryptoWeirds collection will end with number 50)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibew6ke276gb6gi5jo5apavbtu72nlwp44q44ednknxfwpwgjbjgu", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibew6ke276gb6gi5jo5apavbtu72nlwp44q44ednknxfwpwgjbjgu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeibew6ke276gb6gi5jo5apavbtu72nlwp44q44ednknxfwpwgjbjgu", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1iGLEMtpishuV1dWRg8zyT7LeLKEzhupxr"], "tags": ["Illustration", "Digitalart", "fantasy", "character", "animation", "Gif", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "CryptoWeirds", "Collection", "collectibles", ""], "extra": {}}
