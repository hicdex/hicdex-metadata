People have lost their homes, their farms, and their animals. They lost all their life savings\u2026We all lost our trees, animals, and our beautiful nature.\nOur hearts are burning, the hatred and cruelty are suffocating.\nEveryone who got affected by the fire, we are so sorry to say; this is all the collective mistake that we could have prevented. We could have been more prepared. We are so deeply sorry that we created a human hegemony that was so cruel to all living/non-living organisms and all habitats. We are so deeply sorry that we couldn\u2019t even manage to restrain our kind. We are so deeply sorry for everything we have caused. And from the bottoms of our hearts, we wish collective healing for us all.\n\nAll the sales of the artwork will be donated to HAYTAP Animal Rights Federation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRFiNFuo6LbgUss8Nss1DutoU2PUHvjB3wWLsBKjqq8PN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRFiNFuo6LbgUss8Nss1DutoU2PUHvjB3wWLsBKjqq8PN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRFiNFuo6LbgUss8Nss1DutoU2PUHvjB3wWLsBKjqq8PN", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1NcStq4NsNZq9vnH5vNyiWr1EwU5W5i6X7"], "tags": ["gif"], "extra": {}}
