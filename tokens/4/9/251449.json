This song started as a Trap song with samples and arpegios and ended up to be a kind of vaporwave crazy eletronic music.  \n\nThe process of creation and production was minimalist done, only with a laptop, a headset and a lot of research on musical theory. Inspired by the DIY culture, \"Furniture Songs\" shows that virtually anyone can create their sounds without the need for expensive and specific equipment and hard work.\n\n## Are you currently using a medication? Please stop, and come visit our pharmacist.\n\nTrack: 5 of 6\nGenres: Trap, vaporwave, Lo-Fi\nMaster: Rodrigo Paschoal\nRelease Date: Apr 30, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfmGNKJH75LatciYir6iMCUYmqZqvqwNFDtbFPBFhpP6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmkreKxZSMCAJoDeNJ13XjjKVckbph4USmbEcy7cS518", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfmGNKJH75LatciYir6iMCUYmqZqvqwNFDtbFPBFhpP6", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MM2wfCrRzGvXYTt1BsChqsACaF5SJQiVN"], "tags": ["music", "lofi", "trap", "vaporwave"], "extra": {}}
