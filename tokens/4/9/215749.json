Don't you hate it when people look at art and say, \"I could have done that!\" :/ These are all 1-of-1 high-resolution scans of 70 acrylic paintings with a little animation made by me, Kris Kanaly (aka Pyramid Guy). All of the physical paintings have been collected. These are certified authentic NFTs minted by me. Only one copy will be minted of all 70 paintings. Follow me on Instagram: @pyramidguy.
