Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "[Crayon and felt pen on reclaimed cardboard with digital embellishments, ala. Moshville.]  Here is another classic collaboration with my two-year-old granddaughter, Felicity! We drew the original scribble (her lines are much freer and looser than mine) on a chunk of reclaimed cardboard, then I added a few figurative elements (like the jack-o-lantern face), MOSHed the piece to get the mirror and glitch effects, and called it good! I take from this image that a couple of evil jack-o-men are casting a summoning spell (probably on Halloween afternoon) and bringing a strange, other-dimensional creature into our world. That's what I think is happening anyway... ---Richard F.
