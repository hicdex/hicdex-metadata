In this painting you can see a split between the turmoil in the clouds in the sky and the calm clear water gently lapping the shingles. \n\nWe can exist in a space of calm while there is turmoil going on around us. It's not easy but it is possible. Human emotions are complex, in this painting  I am referencing nature as a visual aid to understanding our emotions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiexyeo5y7plsvlqtkrduee3vl6tnvz3ah5kgvvoekip5ijvieikt4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreid4gcygxw5p3gvfq64fyqxvogtken5ulfl64vwhuyxjry7a65apge", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiexyeo5y7plsvlqtkrduee3vl6tnvz3ah5kgvvoekip5ijvieikt4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["seascape", "clouds", "shingles", "watercolor", "painting", "StephanieFuller"], "extra": {}}
