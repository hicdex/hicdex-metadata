{"__version": 1, "token_id": 253649, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Collage #12 (Cannibalism Winter 1964)", "description": "Evaluation of the available evidence supports the hypothesis that cannibalism of kuru victims was responsible for the epidemic spread of kuru through the Fore and their immediate neighbours with whom they intermarry. Clinical disease ensues 4-20 years after ingestion of poorly cooked tissues containing the transmissible agent. The rarity of kuru in men suggests that horizontal transmission of the agent other than by cannibalism is rare, or that it causes kuru of a much longer incubation period. New data suggest that genetic factors are not of major importance in the determination of host susceptibility. Since other cannibal peoples in New Guinea do not suffer from kuru, the kurugenic agent itself may be the unique factor in the \u00e6tiology of the disease. Unless vertical transmission to give kuru from mother to offspring or horizontal transmission of an extended incubation period can continue in the absence of cannibalism, kuru should disappear within the next few decades, by which time most people still carrying the agent will have died from kuru.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaK7KHSwmRN1ozQdWaGrFDkgAqmSC8eusoametnREVMhT", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf9WBmWgiBTUe8sn8vUBGnGwRdErZDH661pnGjV84a2sx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaK7KHSwmRN1ozQdWaGrFDkgAqmSC8eusoametnREVMhT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Collage", "theartofmann", "darkarts", "skull", "surreal", "cannibal", "winter", "1964", "kure"], "extra": {}}
