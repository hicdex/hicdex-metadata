An unframed story\".\n\nWhen you look at the silhouettes and lines of Cities from a bird's eye view, you suddenly notice that each one has its own image, as if people are painting cities - faces - for someone looking down from above!\nThere are almost finished images, continuing to change right now, cities pulsating.\n\nPerhaps when humanity is able to orbit the earth in mass, it will wonder what this or that city looks like from above and the architects will solve that problem too. In the meantime nobody pays any attention to it and the more interesting, the generated images appear as if by accident.\n\nIt only remains for me to exaggerate a little bit these imprints of civilisation on the ground! \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifi2pkygq27vurj2gceo3k6wlgmfwm4hsqlcn34cwzj4rby4re3ta", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigmtlb3jbdzqnkp2yj5h5mvdd7k4xaqgcy2ml7eka7t3srgn3lk3m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifi2pkygq27vurj2gceo3k6wlgmfwm4hsqlcn34cwzj4rby4re3ta", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gZc62y2fzaFCtMdy4WJUuD1CEoSWYt5su"], "tags": ["NewYork", "Ales"], "extra": {}}
