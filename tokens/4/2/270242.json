During the Covid-19 epidemic, every building is covered with QR-Code. People were \"qualified\" to enter buildings by scanning the QR-Code. The order of freedom and rights of our society are reorganized. We collected more than 2000 entrance QR-Codes and photos of National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). We also developed a \"recursive QR-Code program\" for generating the QR-Code of \"Library\" at NTHU from 2000 entrance QR-Codes. We saved it with NFT and auction it as a deal on the NFT trading platform. It records all the responses of NTHU and the campus memory for facing COVID-19 in 2021.
