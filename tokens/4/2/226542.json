On the way from Lihir Island to Madang. It was a Sunday  evening after hard week at port. After dinner I came on deck and I was very impressed with the view that opened all around of me.\nSo beautiful sunsets I saw only at sea. It's the most powerful inspiration for me. What about you?\nDecision to become a seaman I took very suddenly. I grew in small miners city 40 km from Donets. At the last year of school Donbass war began and I had no choices to stay there more. I chose nautical academy in Odessa and it was best decision in my life.\nNo any postproduction made on this picture.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZvTT6Nv43gfaGkLKUBFr9YbtpaFBPj3zihfjeddK5gpQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRNYfKJPf6Ys3jECu9C14gMbsLrszzQHXDEt3MEHwVU6A", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZvTT6Nv43gfaGkLKUBFr9YbtpaFBPj3zihfjeddK5gpQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eTsNNkxKquK96GZXTpyci4HrrB86MzWy4"], "tags": ["Photo", "photography", "sunset", "sunrise", "Singapore", "vessel", "ship", "flag", "sun", "memories", "seaman", "sea", "seafarer"], "extra": {}}
