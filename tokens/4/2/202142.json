It was the first time I saw a tourist in it, she was bright and had a stranger\u2019s light/\n/She looked at the details like she cared for them. I remember the lonely mosque was happy about this visitor/\n-----\n35mm photography from OYS series/ I often walk slow, I like to wait and watch people from behind. A photo from someone\u2019s back is a proof of his/her existence in that time and place. It says nothing more, it shows very few details about that person. Only that they are humans. In OYS, I explore stories of people you don\u2019t see their faces in between notes.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPajyQgTob755NEC1nUhVjqTdJaT5TQxrtrUsqusQ7a33", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbZiq9rYKwU9ViSiTfkmjTwsFDx37iUR9xug3Rcc8bDEH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPajyQgTob755NEC1nUhVjqTdJaT5TQxrtrUsqusQ7a33", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Photography", "Filmphotography", "Photo", "35mm", "Analog", "Human", "People", "OYS", "Photonotes"], "extra": {}}
