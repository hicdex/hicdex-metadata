Soju can be thought of as a Korean drink, but harking back to its 13th century origins, it appears in the Mongol invasions of Korea (1231\u20131259), with the technique of distilling arak that the Mongols Yuan acquired from the Persians. The Chef rescues history, and adds aniseed notes to his artisan soju recipe, to recall his ancestors. This 1/1 video NFT has also a wonderful music made by The Chef, which is also The DJ.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeh1K6uYSXAjAccGokQgCxtXy6WWUMWWd94LEbQvTukYU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPR2AvmfBCLyWcX5o7Yt2SRoJ6fUuDoNcjmiJJpFc4Qr9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeh1K6uYSXAjAccGokQgCxtXy6WWUMWWd94LEbQvTukYU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NxoCNqUXwPbDURpK7gHaqgebyAt8G99xQ"], "tags": ["Voxel", "VoxelArt", "Vox", "Pixel", "PixelArt", "Cryptovoxels", "Music", "Beat", "Video", "GIF", "KoreanFood", "TheChef"], "extra": {}}
