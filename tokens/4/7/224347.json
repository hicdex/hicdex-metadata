You can easily find him in many old photos when he was young, via his bold hair. When he got older, unlike other men in my family, his hair remained as powerful as before, only it turned white. It\u2019s a special white with a glow and at the back of his head, it ends to a grayish kind of white, maybe silver. It\u2019s so soft and glorious, reminds me of a magical bird since childhood. \n||Today on AUGUST 24/ 2021 I miss him a lot, although there's only few hundred kilometers between us, it's been long since we met||\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVtWW7fwUYdFGNdCbStwQjPAT4ZFETLZEV8YT95FkJG2n", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaRPBgj6BTK2tfJjFqDj4mEU7WZv8Ldzi1ENYZEtfCPfX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVtWW7fwUYdFGNdCbStwQjPAT4ZFETLZEV8YT95FkJG2n", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "People", "Photo", "Human", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "35mm", "BW", "streetphotography"], "extra": {}}
