The photo or scan is the only trace.\n\nThis pdf 'zine' is showing a drawing I destroyed on purpose. I was trying to imagine the face of Death, as a young girl dancing toward you. This proved to be too challenging. I was obsessed with it though, In addition to this drawing, I also made several paintings and studies on the subject. It remains a powerful thought that will probably come back in my work in some shape or form.\n\nI drew this in pastel and the pdf contains serveral phases of the face as it morphed over time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWX6WdTmXFHenfoAAhhKTqVMnxbjcxTae89MBbcW82tTZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeBWPgYBcCgtDdcjU6JJt48wvHZPRS6FHUAHyoEQ2oXki", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWX6WdTmXFHenfoAAhhKTqVMnxbjcxTae89MBbcW82tTZ", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1a1L6vroYFXEwLn6A23woo8ae2EgA5QfSy"], "tags": ["death", "allegory", "aurieaharvey", "drawing", "pastel", "pdf", "zine"], "extra": {}}
