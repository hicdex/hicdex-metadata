During the shoot they could hear a series of faint beeps, followed by a low buzzing noise. During the coffee break the assistant decided to go and search for the source of this noise. Underneath a pile of rusted metal and wiring they spotted a faint glow, underneath they found this mask built from bits of scrap. What was strange is that the mask seemed powered yet, after further inspection, there was no signs of any batteries or power source.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbWcvJsEf8JPxLH5Jtp3SgE8Yadj9HxHZ1infxHSqHWcd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRCKkt97ukMnoWFWHHJfva2k6nca71zz4tpMg4Xqh2fVC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbWcvJsEf8JPxLH5Jtp3SgE8Yadj9HxHZ1infxHSqHWcd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hb6YNsTVceJJPMgVYsPhEd6i4mwVLbjjZ"], "tags": ["Mask", "Deathimself", "Junkyard", "2dAnimation", "Robot", "Mech", "Steampunk", "Art"], "extra": {}}
