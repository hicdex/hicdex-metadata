He passed away a few years ago and i haven't been back. When a friend suggested i paint the bridge i never thought i would have so much feelings in it. Guess i was wrong. I should take my kids over there someday and show them all the places i went and the adventures i had, it is just a bridge ride away. RIP Gramps i promise to visit your island soon as i can.
