Each edition features 1 artist in particular for the core box concept. Each box is a low-priced 1/1 edition in comparison to the value of all the NFTs inside. \n\nThis is a one-time, NFT grab bag that, once purchased, content will be sent to the buyer and detached. Then the box is empty and becomes a cool collectible itself.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e EDITION 02\n\ud83c\udfa8 2 pieces by threeeyesonemind\n\ud83c\udfa8 1 piece (1/1) by PL4Y3RN0N3\n\ud83c\udfa8 1 piece (1/1) by URI HD\n\ud83c\udfa8 1 piece (1/1) by Cristina Agassini\n\ud83c\udfa8 & the box itself by Fabi Yamada\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6 Don't miss a drop!
