After many attempts and image processing, Fujisan appeared once more above a sea of clouds.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmReuwR6Z8u4GJV9PM9Z9emgpUTmoJ2WnVKGqbx2nnZufi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSzXEfH4VePb9FEDFzxdCu7hJRHD4VitX4HHM5uZQ8DCZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmReuwR6Z8u4GJV9PM9Z9emgpUTmoJ2WnVKGqbx2nnZufi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TQ3Gi42BHwJvNCDLGFVXxYcn4p9AkrvRC"], "tags": ["photography", "experimental", "glitch", "abstract", "Tokyo", "Japan", "Mount", "Fuji", "Fujiyama", "Fujisan", "celadoor"], "extra": {}}
