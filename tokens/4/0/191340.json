Often it was found in a native form (liquid drops on rocks), but more often it was obtained by roasting natural cinnabar. The ancient Greeks and Romans used mercury to purify gold (amalgamation), they knew about the toxicity of mercury itself and its compounds, in particular mercuric chloride. For many centuries, alchemists considered mercury to be the main constituent of all metals and believed that if liquid mercury was returned to hardness with sulfur or arsenic, then gold would be produced. Pure mercury was described by the Swedish chemist Georg Brandt in 1735. To represent the element both among alchemists, the symbol of the planet Mercury is currently used. But the affiliation of mercury to metals was proved only by the works of Lomonosov and Brown, who in December 1759 were able to freeze mercury and establish its metallic properties in a solid state: ductility, electrical conductivity, etc.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVzihUgCDRoDAuKChLwJrPWFZ4jUppcvECoigN4dpEwyi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRQ9tmZfCkUJDkNdtZps8rBfEBknvPxVAaBYDEBxCKzmB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVzihUgCDRoDAuKChLwJrPWFZ4jUppcvECoigN4dpEwyi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L6qxHK6biAYVKtZTv9FdNKxn8Ko8BtBF5"], "tags": ["lightpainting", "nightphotography", "longexposure"], "extra": {}}
