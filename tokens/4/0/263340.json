The original images depicted events of the current decade in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.  The original images are deconstructed and assembled into a new narrative that is more frustrating and obscure.\n.\nElements of realism make them plausible but abstraction, realignments and mash-ups of the human form, color layering suggests the impossibility of constructing a meaningful whole from available fragments.
