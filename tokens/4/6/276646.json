The orchestral sound that a flock of birds makes at dusk in the center of Palmas is one of the most intense sound marks I have ever experienced. I made this recording tens of meters away from the trees, and yet the sound is as intense as if it were next to the birds. Everyone who has enjoyed the late afternoon in the center of Palmas has been infected by this masterpiece of nature that surrounds us here.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeih7nc7et2s533bynzzctizv64zzjdfqj7u57dgisyd23w5marzxrm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiabttsxhb76jdaibsqhfbtwwcae6tc4jmpy3fus6jfd6tejmo2eji", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeih7nc7et2s533bynzzctizv64zzjdfqj7u57dgisyd23w5marzxrm", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1Tp8PHdx2KsvHyVWb4NaGev8wXLk1HwqCw"], "tags": ["soundscape", "meditative", "nature", "ambient", "wav", "sound", "collection", "brazilian", "city", "birds", ""], "extra": {}}
