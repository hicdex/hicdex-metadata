My eyes are going blind from so much light, from so many souls , I only hear your heartbreaking song, a meow, a purr, a moan, that makes me forget all my memories.\nA soul whispered to me that in 49 days we will return to the post-earth, where will we return? I know it's my seventh day and I don't know where I am.-", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmXZyXix79a7STqns1riQ4L5iCnMGZkQFqwM9KcqG1r5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbAG8qogVo4uPmRwAWo1YQiED1oUAP6TtSog3i4ue81Hg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmXZyXix79a7STqns1riQ4L5iCnMGZkQFqwM9KcqG1r5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gC1EwrnALxrc5EUE2CJAG6qDNpjvoM9XL"], "tags": ["3D", "collection", "mix", "multimedia", "story", "postmedia", "cryptoarg", "www", "2d"], "extra": {}}
