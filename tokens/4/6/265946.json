The images look digital, like old computer games while at the same time having this quality of a painting, to be sufficiently abstract to spark the imagination. I got sucked in and, adjusting, iterating, changing, I created this series. It plays whith the idea of futuristic cyberpunk societies that emerge on new planets and their inhabitants, the SPACERS. I's an ongoing series an I will be releasing it little by little. Every piece of the px edition is 5/5.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfBpotqUrA9oGMpCvMmRdxMob6kUvaKjdhZM89tUfp8NM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVWFGLyWX1haWbNBtUangBmDnrCNnuHpLEk1sf6A76mCc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfBpotqUrA9oGMpCvMmRdxMob6kUvaKjdhZM89tUfp8NM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QyRHPc1w9T4BKHXkNPZnMfQybU5cfFXkx"], "tags": ["ai", "generative", "artificialintelligence", "cyberpunk", "avatar", "pfp", "gan", "character", "space", "sciencefiction", "future"], "extra": {}}
