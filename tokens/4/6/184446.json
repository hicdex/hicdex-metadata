It is a combination of generative \"golden ratio\" based sequencer, additive synthesis and some tricks with realtime rhythmic structure.  I use such a system to generate all my sound to my audiovisual works. Recorded in realtime from the live algorithm. The composition seems to be a rithmic sound. Have a nice listening / using / mixing  process.  No sound effects are used. Pure wave physics.  Microsound. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXzsVBFqUYUWnnYF8kjri3J5XFLGAEo82H19rbSw6cUJN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ6fG8rchZJtepp8Nhsz9kfSjT9zzsjCkC9e3eZ9QqRS9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXzsVBFqUYUWnnYF8kjri3J5XFLGAEo82H19rbSw6cUJN", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1Mpr7WD3UG47UFPbizLPnBCNhh8pcdbSyz"], "tags": ["sound", "algorithm", "procedural", "custom", "coding", "algorithmic", "realtime", "harmonic", "additive", "synthesis", "random", "form", "microsound", "pure", "wave", "oscillators", "harmonic", "composition", "hi-res", "lossless", "44100", "16bit", "stereo", "goldenratio", "rithm"], "extra": {}}
