I made this piece to help build thought and mindfulness that we, as white women/nonbinary femmes, do not need to be in the center and to turn the other cheek. Feminism is more than for white women/people. We should not use our emotions to put people in literal life danger. Think before you call the police/call for help. Think before you release your emotions. Consider the space you take up - it's not always about you.\n- \nMade with magazine clippings from Europe and manipulated in Photoshop.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmajBraNRwatqJ9SRfcvEYeX4yPUCtWpJaGLKLRFC3MF39", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdQvTwgEZkpPNKhsKi2LrbA3qBcwVzfdWaZueQEQb9FPS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmajBraNRwatqJ9SRfcvEYeX4yPUCtWpJaGLKLRFC3MF39", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gADRowRshmxVnXgLRBWU9aH2gvDKc2tLC"], "tags": ["collage", "socialjustice", "mixedmedia", "emotional", "impactful"], "extra": {}}
