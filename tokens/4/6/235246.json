Each star has its own name, which is the name of a star in the Old Testament and contains a thousand secrets. \nHow much of an unfulfilled wish do you have?\nThe last star is the most perfect of them and this is the great and most special desire. This star is very rare and valuable.\nGenerative artwork exploring color and the emergent effect of stacking simple shapes and filling their intersections.which take you on the journey to an imaginary universe. \n\nAll artworks are created using custom algorithms in processing.
