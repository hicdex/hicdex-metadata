{"__version": 1, "token_id": 223146, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Etalaia", "description": "There\u2019s a mineral knoll in the moon in the middle of a lake that May be not too deep, but we don\u2019t know for sure. There are no samples of density and composition for this apparent fluid, see, only until recently we didn\u2019t know there was water in the moon. Neither did we know that it\u2019s gravity acted in corrugated lines. In that sacred place, for the past thousands of years, an organism of absolute innocence has been gestating. Little by little its flesh and its faces begin to develop, with a liberty that only a celestial body can experiment with. Like stars it irradiates energy, light. It was born from the love of those who dreamt her. It\u2019s matter is expressed in all dimensions. She is a goddess.\n\nUNIQUE EDITION", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRgvPKHZJwTKaF1DPdeJRXAU2XFdv7vKMHQKQc59yYz9X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPAwWkfvruM6oKmgm2YJa7Whywj8DwHn2bEPLqsZioca2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRgvPKHZJwTKaF1DPdeJRXAU2XFdv7vKMHQKQc59yYz9X", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XNaBEazkFPaMdoNPbrYv4Gi7fGD9b6zVu"], "tags": ["motion", "unique", "animation", "colors", "psychedelic", "sound", "music", "audiovisual", "3d", "loop", "sculpture", "moon", "zodruz", "alien"], "extra": {}}
