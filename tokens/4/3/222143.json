Does this not excite you, how our universe is so big and our understanding of \"life\" is actually so limited? Our only reference point for life is what we have here in Earth, because what if their chemistry has nothing in common with ours? Do they have DNA, or are they even made of carbon? The options are infinite. But what if they are similar after all? And something about that bugs me, because the craziest thing about it, for me, is that here on Earth, we don't even recognize the humanity in people different than us.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNyo7aosEmvjbar8nAybvSQjNojz59q6FVGkp44YoFuVU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR2Khszw5diF82J5wAv8LPPXAH5t5nmoub42boBjqRwXp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNyo7aosEmvjbar8nAybvSQjNojz59q6FVGkp44YoFuVU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rw2JoU2AK2TNdfhcd4h918CdTGSNh5Gnw"], "tags": ["storytelling", "extraterrestrial", "alien", "astrobiology", "socialcommentary", "gothic", "darkacademia", "scifi", "landscape", "arrival", "literature"], "extra": {}}
