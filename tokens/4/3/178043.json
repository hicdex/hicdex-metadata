When the algae was injected into brain neurons that controlled certain body parts, and flashed with fiber optic light, the resultant body part would move. So far tested on our unfortunate friends, monkeys and rats, but soon on humans with paralysis and similar ailments.\n\nillustration created october 2009 @antiquefuture / justin wood for @WIRED", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQGEzVyCBWHUQ4io5ziiX5kattVk1rosHajxcEfgLBmy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQBFj74J4W3SHnpV6wf5kXfCotaqtJkED7woU2Netjhuj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQGEzVyCBWHUQ4io5ziiX5kattVk1rosHajxcEfgLBmy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VoR2LqBzgCSrmEB2HQUUgtMgjm6g5kQy2"], "tags": ["optogenetics", "genetics", "rainbows", "monkeys", "paralysis", "algae", "illustration", "justinwood"], "extra": {}}
