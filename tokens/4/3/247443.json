In this work, image collections of portraits are being cathegorized by different topics and themes, resulting in vibrant and abstract impressions of these higher level separations. At the same time, combining images in this fashion enables the perceiver to get a broad idea of these visual similarities and can glimpse into the world where one can see multiple images at the same time. By losing the individual images, an unknown layer of perception is opened.\n\n10000x10000px, Marcel Schwittlick (@schwittlick_), 2014", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPFEWNu9LnkacF4Ztx3dekRNvuJRZMsF4L17Ds2yxm6iv", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme8rTzLrBqhBtLi2M6nuQ6xLxGNtgwsZ4LbwmH6zaYmKq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPFEWNu9LnkacF4Ztx3dekRNvuJRZMsF4L17Ds2yxm6iv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1c3hFmjFSwunjLHECnYyjr42KRt5YiHrGX"], "tags": ["processing", "generative"], "extra": {}}
