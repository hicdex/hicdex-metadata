It was caused by a heart condition that I had, unknown, since birth. It caused an irregular heart rate. Since I had never experienced any other, this irregularity was what I conceived of as normal. \n\nI then underwent a procedure to correct the defect and return my heart to a regular rhythm.\n\nSince then, I sense a heightened awareness of my internal rhythm; its difference; its regularity.\n\n\n\nClick to change the palette.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbg22d4YHM7NJPPwXPSd2z4Ns8q1QHfpxRKd6RfPQLzer", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNSRMpmL7xc64eCu21KzJM9aQ6wiVcei6xLsYs1V9U55L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmaqJhGKKASoTHaLoQBzbfg6jfmipjcvP94rcafmXsQq3R", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbg22d4YHM7NJPPwXPSd2z4Ns8q1QHfpxRKd6RfPQLzer", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1eLyW9MuqQcCUQpSEGnKPNHyiXgjnMaxEG"], "tags": ["shader", "regularity", "webgl", "interactive"], "extra": {}}
