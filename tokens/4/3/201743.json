From photo filters, to diets, to cosmetic surgery, is there anything off limits? \n\nAs we preen and pluck away at our flesh, we lose pieces of ourselves in the process while circling around for our next fix.\n\nA PRETTY FACE DOESN'T MEAN A PRETTY HEART, just because something looks nice on the outside doesn't mean that it's nice on the inside. Why do we judge and make assumptions based on our external, superficial characteristics? Are we really that vain and self-absorbed? Like the old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"\n\nA collaboration between @dehiscenceart (collage) and @helldreamer00 (animation/music) 2021.
