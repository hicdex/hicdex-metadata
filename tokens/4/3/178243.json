Meadows grazed by sheep, cattle or horses sometimes produce vast quantities of these fungi of summer and early autumn... but not every year, unfortunately.\n\nIt is unwise to treat cap colour as a significant feature when identifying these kinds of mushrooms. Some Field Mushrooms are smooth and almost pure white while others are quite rough with dark-brown cap scales.\n\n@cryptomushii", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX4CSABLSyePVqcqM9ES6cAmA3WA4wut4bZbKxGMxGDvL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX4CSABLSyePVqcqM9ES6cAmA3WA4wut4bZbKxGMxGDvL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX4CSABLSyePVqcqM9ES6cAmA3WA4wut4bZbKxGMxGDvL", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
