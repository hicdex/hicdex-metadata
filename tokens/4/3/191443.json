The syringes and the vials are easily bought at pharmacies in Hong Kong and online from Malaysia / Thailand. One had to make sure that the needle is long enough for it to reach deeper muscle tissues. Most trans men often bought the syringes and testosterone vials by themselves prior to visiting doctors in clinics or hospitals. They usually inject every three weeks for faster female-to-male transitions. The syringe can cost HKD $5 = 0.6 EURO. The T vial for one injection costs HKD $205 = 22 EURO if bought in Hong Kong, but only HKD $64 = 7 EURO if you buy it online from a Malaysian website.\u201d\n\u2013 Denise Tse-Shang Tang \n\nDenise Tse-Shang Tang is Assistant Professor at the Department of Cultural Studies and Associate Director of the Centre for Cultural Research and Development at Lingnan University Hong Kong, researching gender and lesbian sexualities, social spaces and cultural politics in Chinese societies.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSjEckDiUfBTSu1VCyFDfrYTZrgjj8euPscSzQDmYVjSb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYMPM3E9By3myBRGqc61iscyBEJ3YzNFdeYeou99Zjbho", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSjEckDiUfBTSu1VCyFDfrYTZrgjj8euPscSzQDmYVjSb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NisvvqYZE1dgsJTY14XL64xbsNudSAgTS"], "tags": ["TestosteroneNeedle", "DeniseTse-ShangTang", "KunstvereininHamburg", "SimonDenny", "ProofofStake"], "extra": {}}
