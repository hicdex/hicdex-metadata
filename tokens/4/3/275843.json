It can inspire for generations and reminds the audience that our universe is capable of producing the unexpected time and time again.\n\nWhat is around the corner? We cannot predict, but let's be excited about the future and not live in fear.\n\nPerhaps the magic of the universe will work in our favour?\n\nArtist: Tiago Hands [4,560 Youtube subscribers, 38,700 organic followers on Instagram (mathematics.proofs)]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiahz3vogr4tb4zzftslfpeuyatpkzquyybxnptm3loq2r5yn5i2lu", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreihnm4flzgxlvdpjgqupzkieet4g4on42hcbjdzcqptpmey5mkebiq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiahz3vogr4tb4zzftslfpeuyatpkzquyybxnptm3loq2r5yn5i2lu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1V7m4qYa42CN9yiybnqgNTGDKxd5rypdV2"], "tags": ["opticalillusion", "hocuspocus", "geometric", "geometry", "math", "mathematics", "illusions", "isometric", "impossibleobject", "sacredgeometry"], "extra": {}}
