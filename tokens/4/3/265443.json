Free from the idleness of my home.\nI met a stranger along the path who is standing idle ,we had a chat and i moved on , the walk getting longer and longer, i was getting farther and farther away from my home , surprisingly i liked it. Don't know how long i walked ,my legs started paining and suddenly i want to go home. MY HOME. I started running towards it , I'm panting but I'm not stopping anytime soon. I will only rest once i get there. I'm running even harder and started feeling I'm not gonna make it.\nMy vision became blurry, and someone hit me in the head.\nThen I realised I fell from the bed and it's all a dream ,felt great ful for staying inside my home. \n\nStay indoors - Stay safe", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeig5i4srvaruwwukasppzykbxidkrjsj4rkfny5inzwgfwmvsebpdm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibbnhtvne5i4gsbhngw5l5ch2vhdwoazydheucap3wprsz3aq3mya", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeig5i4srvaruwwukasppzykbxidkrjsj4rkfny5inzwgfwmvsebpdm", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UeuJvgJXArgTvsf6WKvydX4rMj42QoNu3"], "tags": ["#Farm#nft"], "extra": {}}
