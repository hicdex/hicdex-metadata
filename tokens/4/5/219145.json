Message me thru my twitter account, linked to this profile and we'll get you the physical artpiece! Thank you so much for sharing the love!\n\nYin Yang bracelet including hand-made box chain!\n\u2728\nFeatures Australian Coober Peddy Opal and Baltic Amber, both hand-carved and polished by meself \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc8e\n\u2728\nOpal is a stone of transcendence, higher self connection and embodiment, all-pervasive awareness, and healthy spaciness...sometimes grounded spaciness. Rainbow Body is quite prominent with this stone in the aura. Visualizations, akashic access, intuition, and out-of-body experiences are empowered superbly with this stone.\nBaltic Amber is a stone of memories, ancestry, and very deep rootedness. Impermanence is a natural occurrence in this realm, and radical acceptance of this experience improves the ease of connection with the past and future self.\n\u2728\nA little Alpha and Omega action for ya, get that balance going in your life! Super heady Opal and super grounding amber! This one will really come alive by the water too \ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udf0a\n\u2728\nSong: \u201cStrange Children\u201d by Hajna", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY7WthcFsRYPH5eSh3rGTx8JwAsjkJV6w8gDvA94EWp6y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTGdo5nUSVG8BoZMZRCVy3EBALcpp5a6AuHJpq1Jx688P", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY7WthcFsRYPH5eSh3rGTx8JwAsjkJV6w8gDvA94EWp6y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fyzeSfRFPnps1BjUQ5AMWdtkoj362Uuk2"], "tags": ["yin", "yang", "energy", "tao", "love", "balance", "opal", "amber", "crystals", "copper", "metal", "bracelet", "chain", "link", "wire", "wrap", "new", "earth", "alchemy", "magick"], "extra": {}}
