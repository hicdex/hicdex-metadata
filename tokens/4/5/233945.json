{"__version": 1, "token_id": 233945, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Technical Fabric Sculpture #2 ", "description": "Technical Fabric sculptures are a mix of analog and digital processes with Virtual Reality abstract drawing. I bring a reference of a video still into the VR program Gravity Sketch and use the reference to add lines and shapes to enhance/bring to life the original rescan. All reference images were made with video hardware/mixers with internal video feedback and rescanned off a CRT monitor with a digital camera. The Stills and Virtual Reality drawings are united together in Photoshop. \n\n2413 x 1749 pixels ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTYEvLYfnfEauMUeuHLFA9NdLHYiB9YtJKqPcxVzhn7J5", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8vhyj37s8RcaZNoL7u1MJSgQqjvhUNnNWitjHjrsq78", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTYEvLYfnfEauMUeuHLFA9NdLHYiB9YtJKqPcxVzhn7J5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UiA3Nkg2Ugy2BPqorU7V5LPwCukK5wZd3"], "tags": ["vr", "vrart", "virtualreality", "videofeedback", "feedbackloop", "mixedmedia", "sculpture"], "extra": {}}
