Tormented, this sankyaku is known for passing on its pain to its victims in increasingly cruel ways, making sure to feed while its prey is still alive. \n---\nThe Sankyaku is a three-legged demon that has no arms, but a singular monstrous head attached to a massive neck. It swings its long neck around, smashing its own head into prey before biting them. Its massive neck muscles and jaws allow it to grab prey, lift it into the air, and then smash it onto the ground until the prey dies.\n\nSankyaku, while imposing, are categorized as Creeper. Due to its large girth and slow gait, these demons can be easily dispatched by terrestrial means. Although like all demons it cannot be permanently killed, sufficient wounds in its fleshy body can destroy the corporal body and return its essence to the Abyssal Void.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaybagzqyxe3qbkuaebhispzuracjxyfilp5yoepunu5y4rotno5y", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiepjexznhw4jgwvaamrda6qzkpgphxpeuh7w7xfams3snt64h2wii", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaybagzqyxe3qbkuaebhispzuracjxyfilp5yoepunu5y4rotno5y", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkwheelNFT", "darkart", "horrorart", "demon", "monsters", "1/1", "creeper"], "extra": {}}
