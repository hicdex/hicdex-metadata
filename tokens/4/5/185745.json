{"__version": 1, "token_id": 185745, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OBJKT", "description": "This interactive OBJKT attempts to query the hic et nunc contract on the Tezos blockchain to obtain the latest number of OBJKTs minted and will render the artwork with a series of lines to represent each of the digits of that number. It makes these queries without any 3rd-party web APIs, technically making it more resilient. Instead, it communicates directly with Tezos RPC nodes using an embedded Taquito JS library, and is programmed to cycle through 5 of the currently most popular community-run nodes (Tezos Giga Node from Tezos Ukraine, SmartPy, Blockscale on behalf of the Tezos Foundation, ECAD Labs, Teznode from LetzBake!), should any one of them fail. At time of writing, communication to these nodes from hic et nunc are not yet whitelisted, hence will not query successfully. This whitelisting request is currently in-flight. If and when the whitelisting is done, the piece will finally render the latest number of hic et nunc OBJKTs and will continue to do so every 15 seconds. Until then it will simply render 9 plain vertical bars. | Made in p5js | Created: 26 July 21 | Artist: @Yazid", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdBnwtDKoBXypkNSnSGdzLYMJ2H5YoyCLphH4gW7v7U1C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUghdipdQ1ekymGQEeQ7T1R9SsTSQpXKDmad9smaJBEo1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmUjeiz9wrmtCVV3o6QBLuNegf9nJziNZqi3wMaD7PTfci", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdBnwtDKoBXypkNSnSGdzLYMJ2H5YoyCLphH4gW7v7U1C", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1QgjmhrUD3X7kgS9mMHbUz4cS6uDiFGhAU"], "tags": ["yazid", "interactive", "experimental", "generativeart", "p5js", "abstract", "tezos", "taquito"], "extra": {}}
