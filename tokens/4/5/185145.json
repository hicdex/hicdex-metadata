More than 2,000 ships are believed to have been wrecked upon the Goodwin Sands out in front of the town where I live. The few miles between the sands and the coast is used as a safe anchorage and a refuge from bad weather. I wake early to walk on the seafront and experience the clouds and sunrise out to sea over the Goodwin Sands.\nLook really close and see what you think is happening out at sea in this painting.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPUXptjyCpnzTskLodNNZ5EbKJC84M8qPaReiRVNyBEx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYpds5oEvZauvYQutvFqLJBRRuWhETiNoZ7RyHBKZqGLe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPUXptjyCpnzTskLodNNZ5EbKJC84M8qPaReiRVNyBEx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Storm", "Painting", "StephanieFuller", "Seascape", "clouds", "watercolor", "watercolour"], "extra": {}}
