When I think of a whales I hear their songs. I feel their movement.\n\nWhen I  lived  on the south coast of New South Whales I saw many whales each migration season. Scanning the sea is something I still do here in my new home on the Kent Coastline. My cold water swimming friends often mention it.\n\nI know the days they would be out there if there wasn\u2019t all that shipping traffic passing through the Channel.\n\nI paint these creatures to remind us of the importance of our oceans and seas and the creatures that live in them. \n\nThe Peace of Whales is the first watercolour of a whale I\u2019ve done and the first in a new series of whale paintings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRuCBXE6ee9DjmF3SXpNREKDC4fQTiEBdqZZ2sofvHUip", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZJ6GzkWTKsWPfHvtUzJmQoXvP2BHngZQuAco1ayeCoPK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRuCBXE6ee9DjmF3SXpNREKDC4fQTiEBdqZZ2sofvHUip", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["whale", "whales", "StephanieFuller", "watercolor", "painting"], "extra": {}}
