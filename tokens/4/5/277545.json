I saw him and a friend skating at Jones Hall, I asked if I could take a few photos. Brendan jumped on that idea and immediately started to show out.\nAfter about 10 minutes of photos, I told him about my notebook and the idea of behind it. He took it off to the side and sat alone to write in it. After returning, he thanked me. He said he gladly took the photos and wrote for me because he can tell when others love the city the same way he does.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib4gkeyhup2k2vo22sfclas4sqt77h7mdud5c6vq5aqwolxuslq6q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidbayma74ezkwwrvhcbl7ff2gqrl5v7dcdw3xcaaztccyu3kr4pli", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeib4gkeyhup2k2vo22sfclas4sqt77h7mdud5c6vq5aqwolxuslq6q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
