She was working as a department-store clerk when she met film director Erik Petschler, who gave her a small part in his film. She would go on to become an actress who was one of the most glamorous and popular motion-picture stars of the 1920s and \u201930s. She was best known for her portrayals of strong-willed heroines, most of them as compellingly enigmatic as Garbo herself.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaK2jBRRivmCDF27THw6jx2BPz6X6hsNJ1819jcsaX2by", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTvS9aYWU8dg9LQF232BCnMGs4MCjVtPsCJTAUd6DHu5u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaK2jBRRivmCDF27THw6jx2BPz6X6hsNJ1819jcsaX2by", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
