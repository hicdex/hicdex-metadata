All previously agreed natural laws in the material world are broken; There is no gravity, the construction elements can be whatever you want, in the shape, size and color that you decide, or even in a totally random way. The limits to which we are tied to create spatiality are undrawn, but even so the abstract methods remain the same, that is why this collection refers to space as a metaphor of the place we inhabit, beyond the metaverse, the internet, electricity, the physical world, the earth and the universe.\n\nVideo mp4| 3000x3000| 192 fps", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZi3qtu47v7FhHMAwkRkfVEvjpeeDybdAt9ZhHZMEAae5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdHUzHtwVPgxad9pDQyYC27KhbfUdXPq1Wi2DApExPXwa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZi3qtu47v7FhHMAwkRkfVEvjpeeDybdAt9ZhHZMEAae5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1L91mzG47xaTvCd2iBAQ4ozNcNLjBbs4en"], "tags": ["morphology", "architectural", "parametric", "architect", "space", "architecture", "void", "3d", "blender", "rhino", "metaverse", "generative", "pipeline", "grasshopper", ""], "extra": {}}
