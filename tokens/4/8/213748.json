When she heard that Mr. Maezawa had paid $110.5 million she called her older sister, Lisane Basquiat, in California. \n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot to say,\u201d Lisane said in a rare telephone interview. \u201cWe were speechless.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n\"When I first encountered this painting, I was struck with so much excitement and gratitude for my love of art. I want to share that experience with as many people as possible.\" -Yusaku Maezawa\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUQQMOFDStN/?taken-by=yusaku2020\nhttps://tweetstamp.org/865426927829401601", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWmGrToNE5JJpDqxvGWN49syZrhrL7zktrdrDmQqAzcq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX24PrJL1XYYEvGRo8U4LtJCciHPkdz9LNP8sddD65fsH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWmGrToNE5JJpDqxvGWN49syZrhrL7zktrdrDmQqAzcq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZC4tPkzyDam8P5V3TJdsCj29ucK5EEHY9"], "tags": ["ai", "A.I.", "artificialintelligence", "aiart", "GAN", "generative", "generativeart", "machinelearning", "ML", "vqgan", "clip", "experimental", "neoexpressionism", "basquiat", "Yusaku", "Maezawa", "collector", "portrait", "b_squ_at"], "extra": {}}
