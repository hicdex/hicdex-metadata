I PERSONALLY LIKE THE BORED APE PROJECT BUT I AM NOT DOWN WITH SLAPPING PEOPLE IN THIS SPACE WITH CEASE AND DESISTS OR WHATEVER OF THAT NATURE.  I COME FROM THE SATOSHI MINDSET AND HAVE OPENLY ANNOUNCED THAT I AM AN 'OPEN-SOURCE' ARTIST, THAT MY WORK IS ALREADY IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.  FEEL FREE TO REMIX ANY OF MY WORK, COPY IT ETC. THIS IS HOW BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, BEGINNING WITH BITCOIN WAS ABLE TO GROW AND EXPAND.  IF SATOSHI WOULD HAVE MADE THE CODE CLOSED SOURCE, WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A CAMBRIAN-LIKE EXPLOSION OF BLOCKCHAINS THAT WOULD OPERATE FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES (INCLUDING THIS ONE THAT WE'RE USING NOW).  OPEN SOURCE IS THE WAY AND THIS WAS MY PROTEST AGAINST OLD AND ARCHAIC COPYRIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT.
