I have no idea how she got there, or who had placed the stones upon her but she was dead & cold, a naked pale blue corpse.\n\nWandering drunk, a careless group of teenagers watched from down the dimly lit vacant street trying to figure out what it was they were seeing. They knew what they were seeing but they were trying to comprehend what they already knew & didn\u2019t want to believe they were witnessing.\n\nWhile the group seemed eager to move on and leave the disturbing scene behind to be forgotten, forever locked away in a vault of memories they decided were better left undiscussed, one tearful young woman looked back in distress & horror begging her posse to stay and do something. She herself felt powerless but she put up a fight.\n\nI awoke as they were pulling her away much to her disagreement with tears in her eyes leaving the poor dead girl behind.\n\nH e a v y s t o n e s l e f t u n t u r n e d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaXiyFWJbB2hB5wd7MwSHWBfDYemjFvCcVX5wa5cr4U6Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdUoTtKTUgKVf1YXrtHS5bvYN7tVLk7frff5cFexxJo86", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaXiyFWJbB2hB5wd7MwSHWBfDYemjFvCcVX5wa5cr4U6Y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TsS3XW9JVRRecy5CHNT94ddxVXFJUGLVf"], "tags": ["darkart", "pastel", "stoned", "heavy", "expressionist", "surreal", "surrealism", "drawing", "pendrawing", "visceralsuspicon", "dreams", "fantasy", "dark", "digitalart", "mixedmedia"], "extra": {}}
