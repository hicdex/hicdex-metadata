At the seaside and in the forest. my negative emotions are always soothed. At the same time, nature has always been a source of inspiration for me. \nSince childhood, I have loved watching the documentary\"animal world\". During my work at Beauty Of Science, the company\u2018s business was science popularization and education. I have contacted and learned a lot about animals, plants, and nature.\nIn the Greek cultural tradition. the legacy left to mankind is one of natural science and one of art. Natural science lies in the fact that when a man faces nature. he first understands nature, and second, he controls nature and treats everything in nature as the possession of man, and he controls it. \nBut art is different: when it confronts nature, it does not raise the desire to possess and dominate, but coexist and co-prosper with nature with appreciation. I hope to explore the interaction between man and nature through my artworks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdibL44eavSFsD3Qj5NL3e783VB7qeUvjxszh55xNV6V8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWC37qgEY8ZwyadN8pvjGsRGXQ5T9ZqPRvwgCwMkNjk8g", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdibL44eavSFsD3Qj5NL3e783VB7qeUvjxszh55xNV6V8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1f8WY3gZZXcuhLGZnKDqbpyjZrAJ8qr3Cb"], "tags": ["Illustrations", "Mixedmediamaterials"], "extra": {}}
