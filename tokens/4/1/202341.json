I asked them to stage it, to tell me where to stand, and what to do. I also asked them to place their hand in the frame.\nI gave them total control.\n \nAt that time it was already two years since I\u2019d left home. I lived in England doing my MA and getting what\u2019s called \u201clife experience\u201d. I put lots of effort into building bonds with places and people around me, yet, no matter how hard I tried, in the end I was only a distant observer, a foreigner. The world seemed to be just a screen and I was desperate to tear it, to get through, and get a real physical connection with what was beyond.\nThis performative act became a playful way to do it. Placing myself in a position of an object I questioned the common artist-vs-model dichotomy and explored issues of vulnerability and control \u2013 this photographic process tested not only myself but also limits and desires of others.\n \nIt was a game. Solitude, my body, and will of unknown people were the players. Each of us won.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcGqkSq6CzKx54XJM5rMKfzwGvEGB3t9vQinv1GbQkYwL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYbBgSe2aCAj8hGdeu5fkG1PZTdmzgZFYYcpc7PYQuig3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcGqkSq6CzKx54XJM5rMKfzwGvEGB3t9vQinv1GbQkYwL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NPaC5iaBa1jVBdd6jQLua7rkHPUSntWsd"], "tags": ["performance", "interactiveart", "interaction", "authorship", "bwphotography", "portrait"], "extra": {}}
