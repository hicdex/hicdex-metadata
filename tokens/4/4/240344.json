Paulista in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, in the apocalyptic and chaotic context of the pandemic in Brazil. Despite this scenario, \"A Single Furniture\" brings the listener an atmosphere of cozy, relaxing and hopeful retreat that can be enjoyed along with everyday activities such as working, studying, doing the dishes or cleaning the house.\nThe process of creation and production was minimalist, done only with a laptop, a headset and a lot of research on musical theory. Inspired by the DIY culture, \"A Single Furniture\" shows that virtually anyone can create their sounds without the need for expensive and specific equipment and hard work.\n\nTrack: 1 of 6\nGenres: Chill-Out, Ambient, Lo-Fi\nArt: @pixillian\nMaster: Rodrigo Paschoal\nRelease Date: Apr 23, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYbJVBviQgzNoFpU8vMuPHSPMLTtMt12we4E5rJReCRR5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRWsLCogBrLaccFk9PKzMgExCtX56CugsoRYHNv34PA7y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYbJVBviQgzNoFpU8vMuPHSPMLTtMt12we4E5rJReCRR5", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MM2wfCrRzGvXYTt1BsChqsACaF5SJQiVN"], "tags": ["music", "lofi", "chill-out"], "extra": {}}
