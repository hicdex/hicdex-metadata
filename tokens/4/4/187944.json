Minos prayed to the sea god Poseidon to send him a snow-white bull as a sign of the god's favour. Minos was to sacrifice the bull to honor Poseidon, but owing to the bull's beauty he decided instead to keep him. Minos believed that the god would accept a substitute sacrifice. To punish Minos, Poseidon made Minos' wife Pasipha\u00eb fall in love with the bull. Pasipha\u00eb had the craftsman Daedalus fashion a hollow wooden cow, which she climbed into in order to mate with the bull. The monstrous Minotaur was the result.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWpYnPnQvJ9MbouvSmnioawV9nCoajHaKV4FPHYiMqfkA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWpYnPnQvJ9MbouvSmnioawV9nCoajHaKV4FPHYiMqfkA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWpYnPnQvJ9MbouvSmnioawV9nCoajHaKV4FPHYiMqfkA", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YuyeYd9VhZ5QWR1Q9X8ikiRcmMCvmKJWw"], "tags": ["minotaur", "crete", "abstract", "bitmap", "animation", "gif"], "extra": {}}
