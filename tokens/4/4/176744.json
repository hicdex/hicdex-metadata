Technique: Javascript. \u201cCatcha\u201d is part of \u201cI\u2019m not a robot\u201d, a series of applications exploring the murky world of digital labour and human intelligence tasks. A captcha seems like a harmless annoyance to a user, but it\u2019s a powerful and lucrative method of extracting free labour as we\u2019ve collectively been training AI for free by solving Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA puzzles for decades. To date, it\u2019s estimated that Google has extracted $7.3 billion worth of free labour using this method. Data labeling is the fuel that powers machine learning. The artist messes with this process to generate images that are impossible to identify by feeding thousands of cat images to an AI model specialized in identifying cars. It resulted in absurd looking creatures that are neither cat nor car. Regardless of the selections made, the application will continue to ask for more. The viewer is encouraged to click and click, offering an ever increasing amount of precious intelligence training for free.\nhttps://desbiens-desmeules.com/im-not-a-robot/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbU95iBX254V9wuZ95Zx1XwRZQr9WNrK6hMGT9Qd8c1jF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZc3o5kBhYraq2LgwcBKviWDP3hnJV1YGCgQ116wQEreB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZc3o5kBhYraq2LgwcBKviWDP3hnJV1YGCgQ116wQEreB", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbU95iBX254V9wuZ95Zx1XwRZQr9WNrK6hMGT9Qd8c1jF", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1Q5kA2FxYJAVV8DXrTcmFwqejc1T5iTfqb"], "tags": ["Digitallabour", "crowdworker", "clickworker", "microwork", "microtask", "Datalabeling", "digitalrights", "aitraining", "Captcha", "hit", "humanintelligencetasks", "freelabour", "playbour", "bigfour", "Bigtech", "GAFAM", "bigfive", "GAN", "artificialintelligence", "machinelearning"], "extra": {}}
