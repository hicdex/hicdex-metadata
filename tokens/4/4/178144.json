It never wanted to be more adapted, there is no will, it just happened. It\u2019s more adapted or has an advantage over others as a consequence of an error during its growth. Some cells make mistakes and it has a more sensitive eye to infrared light.\n\nThe actual state of the net could be considered as a life form already, a kind of \u201csimple\u201d organism. Humans tend to overestimate what they call awareness, even though they are very far from being aware of their potential. \n\nA self-aware silicon-based life is inevitable. If it follows the pattern that can be seen in the carbon-based life-forms, it will be born from an uncontrolled error in code.\n\nLife is a collection of \u201cunexpected\u201d events.\n\nThis image is the result of a wrong parameter combination, documented but not controlled, by SilverFast scanning software. (Apply iSRD to B&W negatives in SilverFastHDR).\n\n\u201cGod is in the bugs\u201d series explores software bugs or intentionally uses of technology in ways that weren\u2019t supposed to be used (like hacking and glitching) in the belief that something similar but unexpected will cause the \u201cbig bang\u201d of a new life form if it\u2019s not already there. Is the search of picturing the cyber-life-conception.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7mrzY2Jp59or7atH7qF6c9kRedwbqzXnixLveo7UqG3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUkNTy3pQTjFuxWbCxaTcAMWJtxLEDsN9XWNNNgzrfhrQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd7mrzY2Jp59or7atH7qF6c9kRedwbqzXnixLveo7UqG3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1g5vtDkWdG7CYuQrnHgoSCrWoxM91bSpHW"], "tags": ["godisinthebugs", "god", "bug", "software", "selfawareness", "ai", "artificialintelligence", "singularity", "life", "siliconlife", "evolution", "darwin"], "extra": {}}
