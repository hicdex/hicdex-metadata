We discovered that for \ud835\udc41=3, \ud835\udc41=4 and \ud835\udc41=5, the resulting quotients (to be strictly accurate: once we have compactified by cusps) can basically be thought of as (the surfaces of) Platonic solids, respectively the tetrahedron, cube and dodecahedron, perhaps best thought of as the spherical versions of those solids. These are curved surfaces tiled regularly with a finite number of regular \ud835\udc41-gons, with 3 of the tiles meeting at each vertex. This view in terms of tiling also works for the \ud835\udc41=2 case, which involves a tiling by 3 bigons. The residual action of PSL(2,\u2124) on these quotient surfaces is then precisely the symmetry of the tiling.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQU1ofmXP56WMrKLtGRBrEfw9eD14FSC47AmW6PPJSBx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRL2Pe3FRq62p6ExuE6NuAoFYjA5LmoRUUxuxGYqZYUoS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQU1ofmXP56WMrKLtGRBrEfw9eD14FSC47AmW6PPJSBx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Heptagon", "Collage", "theartofmann", "darkarts", "lips"], "extra": {}}
