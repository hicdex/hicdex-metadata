It's considered to be the most complete and systematic collection of data on an entire medieval aristocracy. The inquest produced new classes of fief holders at the same time that it provided the documentation necessary for the expansion and administrative consolidation of Thibaut\u2019s Champagne. The transportable and compact technology of the roll allowed for real time amendments (such as the sewing of membranes) and thus the introduction of new classes of property owners (e.g. women).\u201d\n\u2013 Marisa Galvez\n\n\nMarisa Galvez is Associate Professor of French and Italian, and by Courtesy, German Studies and Comparative Literature, and Director of Structured Liberal Education at Stanford University (USA).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWHgE9yZ89ogYRrG3Y6Dq1uoM7kWobrbz8dRct2kF2iH9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmexEe7sQj4vDj9UXy5qjUR4GRXdf3FJ2dFFAnR9W54Sbq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWHgE9yZ89ogYRrG3Y6Dq1uoM7kWobrbz8dRct2kF2iH9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NisvvqYZE1dgsJTY14XL64xbsNudSAgTS"], "tags": ["CartularyRoll", "MarisaGalvez", "KunstvereininHamburg", "SimonDenny", "ProofofStake"], "extra": {}}
