Some of the murals from those pyramids are replicated here.\n\nA Wak'a, or Huaca, is a Kichwa / Quechua (people which traditional language is known as Runa Simi) concept that refers to sacred or ominous places, whether lakes, rivers, mountains, caves, but also structures built by humans, including those pyramidal edifices built by the Moche / Mochica people, some left abandoned centuries before the rise and expansion of the Tawantinsuyu, the Inca State, that in the 15th century fought the Chim\u00fa, the descendants of the Mochica.\n\nIllustration and animation by Zamahel\nhttps://linktr.ee/zamahel\nhttps://twitter.com/itzamahel\nhttps://instagram.com/itzamahel ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX1S8E7Ywvn3sN1k4h3mpbRvbCFyV52m7ewxwHM8cDCMa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX1S8E7Ywvn3sN1k4h3mpbRvbCFyV52m7ewxwHM8cDCMa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX1S8E7Ywvn3sN1k4h3mpbRvbCFyV52m7ewxwHM8cDCMa", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1eFB4QTvmxTsVetkQFdtjBkPnDpYaSsbGT"], "tags": ["animated", "animation", "illustration", "painting", "gif", "scifi", "characterdesign", "pyramid", "peru", "brazil", "brasil", "culture", "history", "andean", "andes", "robot", "warrior"], "extra": {}}
