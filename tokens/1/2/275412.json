{"__version": 1, "token_id": 275412, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hexagon Einstein-Rosen", "description": "This is an isometric piece created by Tiago Hands, a mathematical artist based in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe idea came from a speculative structure called the 'Einstein-Rosen bridge' which links disparate points in spacetime. The Einstein-Rosen bridge is also know as a 'wormhole'.\n\nAs you can see in the image, there is a long way to get from one side of the hexagon to the other, plus there is also the shortest route. The shortest route passes through a sort of illusory tunnel - which makes the artwork so intriguing.\n\nThis is a piece of art for science fans and anyone who loves optical illusions. It also appeals to deep thinkers as there are many ways to interpret the image. Isometric constructions by their very nature are related to sacred geometry so there is also a mystical element to the design.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeieg3rebx5pyjxwl3o2hxs5igams4jimlo3terbuwzw2l77a4s33oq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibnvjepsyfc2iwd3ytmplhq52rftk5rado6nw6sm7cno3bdwqh24q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeieg3rebx5pyjxwl3o2hxs5igams4jimlo3terbuwzw2l77a4s33oq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1V7m4qYa42CN9yiybnqgNTGDKxd5rypdV2"], "tags": ["isometric", "opticalillusion", "sacredgeometry", "geometry", "wormholes", "hexagon"], "extra": {}}
