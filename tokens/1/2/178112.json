He himself proposed a full-body composition (tattoo) based on the interpretation of the stories and singularities of the bearing bodies that until the moment of making the tattoo did not know what composition they would find, his only reference was my visual and aesthetic discourse. Many of the graphic elements found in these works that I present to you emerge from those compositions, they are loaded in some way with the stories of these people who summoned me to transform their bodies. As a result of this, I appropriated those stories and built this other alternative scenario in which harmony, melancholy and rhythm dialogue with each other to create a new universe, a resting space of suspended possibilities.\nMy work in general, exploring new tools and formats, is always a drive action to create imaginary landscapes, shelters, to constantly search for gadgets with which to achieve a rarefied reality in which I live, a gadget that gives me back the sense that all this that eh / they have organized, this reality that we know, is our responsibility and we can change it even for a few moments.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVyBqsmMMt5zFHmg2KrdBbAm553AF2JoowdBWpLJPuGRs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPFLcvkvSkJYZKprhK47xyz53NDpK7kG1aNRgA7SUA6gK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVyBqsmMMt5zFHmg2KrdBbAm553AF2JoowdBWpLJPuGRs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zfhbcdzr7XWCFBKHxaieDreojxA76yNsp"], "tags": ["black", "white", "abstract", "landscape", "digital", "analogical"], "extra": {}}
