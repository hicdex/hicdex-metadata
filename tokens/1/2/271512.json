No particular reason why I named this pieces in Latin, just though they sounded and look better specially given the artstyle.\n\nMore technical aspects, original handmade piece was drawn on 50% recycled coffee cups A4 paper cut by me, using Sakura Micron Pens, 0.4 and 0.1. The color is set as a dimed yellow overlaid on a TrueGrit Texture of paper in order of mimicking a gold engraving on black textured paper.
