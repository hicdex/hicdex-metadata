Unlike the meditation series where I don't have a plan, for Breathe I wanted to keep the animation in time with breathing, so as to be helpful when anxiety attacks come.\n\nThe original gif is based on the deep breathing technique I learned which is a slow deep breath in for 5 counts, hold, slow breath out for 5 counts, pause, and repeat.\n\nThis is the original unedited gif before it was sent to 4 collaborators who added their own touches and interpretations to Breathe.\n\n111 x 111, 110 frames, 10 fps. by @mumu_thestan ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmURdmeiTVZgMfUe7DtkRpVmC683NqVxTSkQRAzaGGboT9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmURdmeiTVZgMfUe7DtkRpVmC683NqVxTSkQRAzaGGboT9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmURdmeiTVZgMfUe7DtkRpVmC683NqVxTSkQRAzaGGboT9", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cALmpTf7EeeSBXHAX2rcnR4WAP8tSWkt6"], "tags": ["mumu_thestan", "breathe", "meditation", "meditative", "mandala", "deepbreathing", "breathing", "pixelart", "gif", "animation", "monochrome", "pattern"], "extra": {}}
