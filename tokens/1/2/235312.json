Sometimes they called me a chicken because I was crying many times. Who can refuse to cry when a story from somebody could brought you to the same feeling as theirs. It's because I'm feeling it too. A cry can be a really good thing, actually. Being sensitive and emotional could bring peace. It's my job to spread the potion. If you want some, let me know.
