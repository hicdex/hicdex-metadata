This is MELTDOWN, where we have no choice but to let go after being psychically pummeled by the psychedelics flowing through our blood, our brain. This is the prelude to EGO DEATH.\n\nThird in a series of six. You can only receive this piece by collecting GOOD TRIP, the first in the series. You will also receive the other four images for free. Plus, one collector will be randomly selected to be gifted a 1/1 edition of the frozen blood macro photography shot that was the sole input for all the images in this series.\n\n2238x3968 JPG\n\nMinted July 24th, 2021.
