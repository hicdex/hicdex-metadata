My college friends and I have been quoting the movie ad nauseum for over 25 years. And one of the lines we quoted often was \u201cHow can you miss from this distance?\u201d I had been looking forward to the day I could lovingly mock my own child for missing a shot that just about any adult could drop right in. A lighthearted moment that would surely resonate during their formative years.\n\n3480x2160 JPEG\n\nPhoto by Jason Charnick\nTaken in the Bronx, NY, USA", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme8ZvawqcEzGwPwJUkUrWvxEGV43xFJ3AQNmnAVCEjymR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYMP5HmDaBDjnsFTAga8H5zXm97czfEZJHkSQtasX8A4J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme8ZvawqcEzGwPwJUkUrWvxEGV43xFJ3AQNmnAVCEjymR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cBiEqnbzUkXvB79yhntnemWt8TzG7Qxdy"], "tags": ["TheAbsenceIsAlwaysPresent", "GenerativityvsStagnation", "Photo", "Photography", "NiftyFilm", "NewYorkCity", "NYC", "Bronx", "B&W", "Goodfellas", "Scorsese", "#SupportIndieFilm"], "extra": {}}
