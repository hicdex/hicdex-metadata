{"__version": 1, "token_id": 240310, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The girl who saved crypto", "description": "The true origins of Girl Kathleen are unknown even to Kathleen herself. It has been suggested by accomplished nuclear scientists that Kathleen may have been created during the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant meltdown. Due to his mutant physiology, Kathleen displays an exceptional resistance to the natural nuclear aura of Tezos, which allows the two of them to travel together on their quest, particularly through the first arc of the Official Tezos manga.\n\nKathleen moved to the Stonk Realm approximately one year before Tezos' revival in the late 90s, and became a celebrated crypto-scientist. Kathleen's first appearance in the manga is during Boris' trek through the ashen wastes of Worthing following the detonation of the RDS-46 prototype warhead, during which Tezos is attacked by The Bogdanoff Twins - recently revived as a result of the CRAB-17 procedure being activated. While the fight looked dire, Kathleen shifted from the Stonk Realm to the real world and pulled Tezos out of trouble before he could be recaptured by the twins.
