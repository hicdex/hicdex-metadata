According to the \u2018Volsunga Saga\u2019, Grimhild gave the hero Sigurd a drink of forgetfulness while he was at King Giuki\u2019s court. Sigurd forgot his love for the Valkyrie Brynhild, and married the queen\u2019s daughter, Gudrun. Sigurd was instrumental in the plot to deceive Brynhild into marrying Gunnar. In the Icelandic \u2018Poetic Edda\u2019, Grimhild gave Gudrun a potion in a rune-covered goblet after the murder of Sigurd. Under the potion\u2019s baleful influence, the grief-stricken Gudrun forgot the slain Sigurd and married the villainous and greedy King Atli of the Huns. The deception led to the demise of the Nibelungs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicaisc5aut4i3c73rftocmvcfvm2dnwruswpdqpo6crhqhjjpdk5i", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiaq5zhm3x6girlsbywakxq7q6a6ofuluch2q6upgtui63gei6pzdq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicaisc5aut4i3c73rftocmvcfvm2dnwruswpdqpo6crhqhjjpdk5i", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["characterdesign", "bionic", "biomimicry", "conceptart", "silkmoth", "cyberpunk", "biopunk", "biodesign", "scifi", "digitalart", "cyberpunkart", "3dart#3dcharacter", "purple"], "extra": {}}
