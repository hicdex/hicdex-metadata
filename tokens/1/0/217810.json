Through ArtOwly, these artists have switched on to a new platform exploring the world of NFTs.\n\nTashi\u2019s works reflect upon the culture and traditions of the Ladakhi people. Brokpa, one of the communities of Ladakh, and their harvest festival of Bonona are depicted here in the painting. The harvest festival of Bonona is celebrated with various songs and dances,  most of which are flirtatious. This festival is interpreted as a celebration of the sexual union by the artist. It is represented by the symbols of the sun and moon in the painting. In Tibetan Buddhism, the moon is considered a man and the sun a woman. This is different from most cultures where men are regarded as the fierce sun and women, the dainty moon.  This inspired the artist to re-create these symbols in the painting. Thoughts and practices that existed once in the Ladakhi culture are also addressed in Tashi\u2019s artwork, along with the union and conflict in traditions and the question of belonging.\n\nTashi Namgial is an artist based in Ladakh. Visuals created by him depict the culture and traditions of Ladakh. He has completed his MFA from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.\n\nWatercolour on paper / 3x4 feet.\n\nN.B.
