For me these are enjoyable to just sit and stare at.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXfSBQd7SLqpeiDwam8i2Gcyj4pX9ENK7YoQRnJ8XCYN7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZr2k8oPPH5b6YwnUgP7JPvRgTYsFtgNGrzCxrRMdCqCw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXfSBQd7SLqpeiDwam8i2Gcyj4pX9ENK7YoQRnJ8XCYN7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XqPwDdQdGrL6u1LAwjCksCDUpPXVjRJZp"], "tags": ["ai", "aiart", "vqgan", "clip", "machinelearning", "generative", "GlennIsZen", "surreal", "surrealism", "ganart", "generativeart", "abstract", "computerart", "digitalart", "art", "metaphysical", "spiritual", "nature", "future"], "extra": {}}
