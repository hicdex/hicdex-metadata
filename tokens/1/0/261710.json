Some woman could walk and live together but also many woman are under controlled by their own Helena. Sometimes when it's too strong, Helena could be considered dangerous as an evil spirit in a woman's body. A woman with Helena inside her body could bring threatening atmosphere to others. It's because Helena's strength could lift up the confidence on doing crazy things careful and accurately from analyzing space, time, and events. Some of woman could find their Helena back when they loose it, some are let their Helena go. Helena is you, Helena is us.
