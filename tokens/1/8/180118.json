There are religious leaders who practice what they preach, who are kind and compassionate humans. However, there are some \u2018leaders\u2019 who are absolute frauds. Caring about power and money instead of the people who look to them for spiritual guidance and unconditional acceptance. Preaching hate through their interpretations of a book. \n\nThe only 'saviour' we can rely on is the person we see looking back at us in the mirror. We are responsible for our behaviours, our thoughts, our actions, and reactions to the people around us and to the environment in which we live. We can choose to make the world more accepting and loving. We can choose to be better, to be more caring, thoughtful, and peaceful. It is up to us. One individual at a time, we can make the world a better place.\n\nby @Dehiscenceart 2021, 4200px X 6600px\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbjeem7AQNTeCeSv3tHS2yskxzT291CTjivDPCk84uVEb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZYCkpoqHDKxd2GxhNUTwXzSgDWgrhtpDY3uAP6Zrvbt5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbjeem7AQNTeCeSv3tHS2yskxzT291CTjivDPCk84uVEb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtZmtxhiWc8Nv6AtC1YjVCtJoFjv4nTqL"], "tags": ["ARTWITHAMESSAGE", "SURREALISM", "ANATOMY", "CLEANNFTS", "TEZOS", "NFTCOMMUNITY", "NFTCOLLECTORS", "COLLAGE", "ILLUSTRATION", "AIART"], "extra": {}}
