If you don't like charity, grab a pixel out of support. Will be posting receipts and tasteful proof of distribution to stay transparent.\n\nBack Story: 2019: I was diagnosed with cancer and went through surgery, radiation and chemo. The week after my treatments were completed my baby sister was also diagnosed and also did surgery, radiation and chemo. We were both blessed to have good outcomes. During my extensive treatment, I met so many people suffering. Sitting there drawing with chemotherapy dripping in my veins, I promised that when I got better I would make an art project to give back.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nMake Pixels\nHelp People Struggling With Cancer.\nGo To Step 1\nFunds will be hand delivered to patients that are suffering from cancer. If that should get out of hand, I will be sending ETH directly to cancer wallets.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihjcromew3lynxms4s36zpsnterdop6fi2kodtcorayn4dul5w2dy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicdmv2iifvzh2fo7onbep2cmrjfq6fdma2e6vcp3voti27rw3iofe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihjcromew3lynxms4s36zpsnterdop6fi2kodtcorayn4dul5w2dy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1a2whUhECJwAZtczRSGmZz2rMHgDVD1brB"], "tags": ["pixel", "3d", "cancer"], "extra": {}}
