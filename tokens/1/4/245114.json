Sometimes newbie guests arrive and forget to read the agenda which calls for a quiet picnic, gentle jams with portable electronics, as well as setting the human banter as well as any hint of performance to a minimum. The results get collaged into headphone music. The field recorder was armed upon arrival, so could not resist the temptation to include this temporary disruption.
