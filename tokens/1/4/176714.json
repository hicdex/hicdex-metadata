Being alone, in a home, during this pandemic invoked many emotions. Above all else, it made individuals come face-to-face with another virus, that of loneliness. \n\nFor me, Blue Man embodies the loneliness that I faced. It has given me the ability to look back at the those dispirited days to appreciate both the melancholy and beauty that came about during those months. Without gloomy days we would not be able to recognize the awe of sunny days.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYMFGTjNSQp6LDvujzMXMBcRP8n6DjUSbVPP2QzKwrk3E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXiwWktHvtqDq4fJ8F1VPvrnUNzbQfYbs3mjd1SEZME5L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYMFGTjNSQp6LDvujzMXMBcRP8n6DjUSbVPP2QzKwrk3E", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NYk7bVipVCTTiyqxzrevJiR7jbRH6hFw4"], "tags": ["painting", "paint", "acrylic", "drawing", "emotion", "loneliness", "gloomy", "sadness"], "extra": {}}
