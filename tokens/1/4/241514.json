A changing noise value determines the number of dots in each row and column, and their color. Interactive settings include noise speed ('-','='), max number of points per row/column of one square (numbered keys), total number of grids (scrolling/up & down arrow keys), and light/dark modes ('b') automatically determined based on current time i.e. day or night. Full controls may be found in the web console.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNkr5joMr6fkdL827hZRXdPupSXqJkKopxM7u3E32t76r", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSQJfgQEyTsPK3CXphdeLVEACseyvJE2XdqGYfkqeg4uD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSQJfgQEyTsPK3CXphdeLVEACseyvJE2XdqGYfkqeg4uD", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNkr5joMr6fkdL827hZRXdPupSXqJkKopxM7u3E32t76r", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hjsJLB4iX74cJ8zsemWY7K2mobWBzmee3"], "tags": ["dots", "generative", "geometric", "interactive", "p5js"], "extra": {}}
