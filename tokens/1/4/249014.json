{"__version": 1, "token_id": 249014, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sonder of Loss", "description": "Every person we see as we pass by towns, cities, coffee shops, and parks, have their own stories and lives to live \u2014 hopes, fears, friends, and families \u2014 just like we do. It's a beautiful sentiment, to appreciate the mystery of the complex lives of people around us. And this feeling is actually more common than we think. But my personal sonder lately has shifted to something a little more discomforting, something that breaks my heart when I think about it. The death tolls and statistics in the recent years. The loss of life from wars, poverty, hunger, injustice, and the pandemic. The numbers. I hate it, because they can be dehumanizing. Each number is a life, just as complex as ours. People could say people \"die every day\", but that doesn't dispute my sonder for those who have lost their lives. And more than we care to admit, these deaths are not normal. Every graph and every point in those charts are people's lives, with their own personalities, ambitions, and memories of people they loved.\u00a0", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW2tM1R84Kw1M9MWr6Kmyxu21dUbCjJYZwTTrTpda4vaZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZRZ3wyexvdkLjoof8fn6xtxehppZs418BuD4xtnm6Ryt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW2tM1R84Kw1M9MWr6Kmyxu21dUbCjJYZwTTrTpda4vaZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rw2JoU2AK2TNdfhcd4h918CdTGSNh5Gnw"], "tags": ["spilledink", "loss", "grief", "sonder"], "extra": {}}
