A blowing candle in the wind or a tiny thorn under your skin.\n\n\u201cHere is where it all begins, pin pin pin, you are called to spin: the wheel was passed from kin to kin, will you win your cup of tin?\u201d\n\n\u2028Big and mighty heroes were, is that the flesh you want to wear? Or are you brittle like a stick, crumbling under oh so quick... \n\n\u2028\u2028Crick, crick, crick. Time is passing, others might start trespassing.\u2028 Opt for thickness in your walls, nothing in, all it stalls. Protect your feelings from the wolves, and vanish others from your halls. Lesser be the one who falls but not you the one with BALLS.\n\nBalls so big it hurts to walk, balls so big you cannot talk, balls so hard you break the bench, balls so fat that make you clench. Ain\u2019t it worth it? Be the best! Crush the others leave no rest. Be it all for your big conquest: a kingdom full of those who are less.\n\nBalls you\u2019ll mold as hard as steel, nothing will they ever steal: they can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t feel! Balls for brains will seal the deal.\u2028\u2028 \n\nBut\u2026 \u201coh my kingdom for a horse\u201d is what you\u2019ll whisper to the closing doors, bye-bye balls, it all was false.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiezdaxc2cobqvywj4g2qhoojaeqdxjahgpr36ks7um3okicup6mx4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidjy4seak4v5ysxnsud2zjdp7ztpmpzbvobg4coq7rsnksq6y2gtm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiezdaxc2cobqvywj4g2qhoojaeqdxjahgpr36ks7um3okicup6mx4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aQKoJYGJTZRNDjunJVuPmJeZPKsrRvpBZ"], "tags": ["3d", "story", "illustration", "blender"], "extra": {}}
