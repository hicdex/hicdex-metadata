Invaders could take invisible blows, gore and kick, or fall under the spell of magical illusions, get lost in the woods, or worse.\n\nBut it was possible to offer brandy or tobacco rolls to Anhang\u00e1, asking for their protection. Burning cashew nuts and making crosses with wood from the forest itself also drove him away.\n\nHowever, this only worked if the hunter behaved correctly. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSTKDxD2PBxhkXN9LTkLnZcfymSBpVSZtNuGWSdDtZJyb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSJ2R572Z7cbPzx2whHduidkhB7A2aWthoiUPnWCFNaWh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSTKDxD2PBxhkXN9LTkLnZcfymSBpVSZtNuGWSdDtZJyb", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["naturecurupirawerewolffirecryptolegendslegendsdemonflorestrenanciomontebirdsbrazil"], "extra": {}}
