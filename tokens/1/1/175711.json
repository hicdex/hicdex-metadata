Higher voltage = more separation. voltage controls the alignment of block colors which is their rate of change. Higher voltage = more alignment and thus their color velocities will become the same. voltage controls the cohesion of block colors which is converging on a single color. Higher voltage = more cohesion and thus their colors will quickly become the same and Photron will look like one color", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPxWo5YYZnVdFr8A38ceYSE51AjY8GxgEAppFFM5TciUS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYXBPacBXwWoUGCZLeBW2C6gt3h91a3N3GXiKyayNPQ59", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPxWo5YYZnVdFr8A38ceYSE51AjY8GxgEAppFFM5TciUS", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1TG9d5ACUTVsyASTP2yi412VbW8hf2HUV6"], "tags": ["vcv", "modular", "ambient", "color", "abstract", "music", "noise"], "extra": {}}
