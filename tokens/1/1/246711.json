This photo was taken during a Desert Drive with a 4WD club in Dubai. The area further ahead of the vehicle was dangerous and not suitable to drive. We stopped at this place and returned back to our camp to avoid any risks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdYCn4LLpnh2LHJojoGuque8cW7AVVp2s9igqi7da7rWC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcLK72wy5HJ11G28Q5uHLW8ep9TtPQ87AQMViU6WkD9cv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdYCn4LLpnh2LHJojoGuque8cW7AVVp2s9igqi7da7rWC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dCKrj3161VQa8jrP1na2dz6fUYYPhxvZr"], "tags": ["photography", "desert", "sanddunes", "dubai", "4WD", "desertdrive"], "extra": {}}
