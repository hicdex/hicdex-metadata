Unlike the meditation series where I don't have a plan, for Breathe I wanted to keep the animation in time with breathing, so as to be helpful when anxiety attacks come.\n\nThe original gif is based on the deep breathing technique I learned which is a slow deep breath in for 5 counts, hold, slow breath out for 5 counts, pause, and repeat.\n\nThe collaboration series is my hope to bring different touches to my pixel mediations. The collaborations are with 4 different artists I admire whose styles differ from mine but complement it. The results may change the initial timings and mood of the gif.\n\n@sutu_eats_flies makes amazing AR art and I especially love his hand-drawn neon series, which he makes frame by frame. That, and how mesmerizing his loops are would be a perfect match for the project. And he certainly made it magical.
