{"__version": 1, "token_id": 278511, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Monsieur Fourier n'est plus furieux", "description": "Highly interactive art piece which generates shapes of various complexities. The user can (but does not have to) take control of the drawing by modifying the parameters of the machine and by setting size and brightness of the pen tool.\n\nThis piece forms a pair with \"Monsieur Fourier est furieux\" (OBJKT#265982). Both objects have been created as a collaboration of Kilian Ochs and Janno Bergmann. This joint venture will continue under the name timemachine.tez (https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/timemachine).\n\nBased on the mathematical principle of the Fourier series.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- The work reacts to keyboard input only after a click into the canvas.\n- Sound on! Click once into the canvas to start the sound.\n- Best viewed and controlled in HEN fullscreen mode.\n\n\nThis piece has a DRAW and an EDIT mode. Toggle between them using the [return key].\n\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| Controls in DRAW mode                                    |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n  Enter EDIT mode                               [return key]  \n\n  Toggle DYNAMIC BRIGHTNESS                              [b]\n\n  Change TOOL SIZE                             [mouse wheel]\n\n  DELETE drawing                               [right-click]\n  \n  Graceful END                                   [space bar]\n\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| Controls in EDIT mode                                    |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n  Return to DRAW mode                           [return key]\n  \n\nWhile mouse cursor is placed outside of any object:\n\n  ADD or REMOVE segments                       [mouse wheel]\n  \n  Change PEN SIZE                                    [+] [-]\n\n\nWhile mouse cursor is placed over the center of a circle:\n\n  Change segment RADIUS                        [mouse wheel] \n                                 or [hold left mouse button]\n\n  Change segment SPEED                               [+] [-]\n\n\nWhile mouse cursor is placed over the drawing tool:\n\n  Change TOOL SIZE                             [mouse wheel]\n  \n  Change TOOL BRIGHTNESS                             [+] [-]\n\n  MOVE somewhere else                       [click and drag]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU7b7RrbXhpKWKoBC5z64Zr3qWfvJb7xMPgjC8638gY8D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTAZKSfHyRgfB7nWQq5rtQDHYNdTJkKM97N6Yw733W5u1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmPvCbqH6nAR1ceVksxVma4PP1mnRGoWsTzjLqjeY8ENUq", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU7b7RrbXhpKWKoBC5z64Zr3qWfvJb7xMPgjC8638gY8D", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1STycY3m4j4svmwT1aD4cEYqY81CNqCe3X"], "tags": ["generative", "random", "Fourier", "interactive", "mathematics", "monochrome", "p5js", "3D", "audiovisual", "sound"], "extra": {}}
