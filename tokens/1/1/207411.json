He murdered his father-in-law and could find no one to purify him until Zeus did so and admitted him as a guest to Olympus. Ixion abused his pardon by trying to seduce Zeus\u2019s wife, Hera. Zeus substituted for her a cloud, by which Ixion became the father of Centaurus, who fathered the Centaurs by the mares of Mount Pelion. Zeus, to punish him, bound him on a fiery wheel, which rolled unceasingly through the air or, according to the more common tradition, in the underworld.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaPQjc1UZLx92EYTkvkPGbt7gecFc79dbi5kuGnLavcei", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaPQjc1UZLx92EYTkvkPGbt7gecFc79dbi5kuGnLavcei", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaPQjc1UZLx92EYTkvkPGbt7gecFc79dbi5kuGnLavcei", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YuyeYd9VhZ5QWR1Q9X8ikiRcmMCvmKJWw"], "tags": ["greek", "mythology", "animation", "gif"], "extra": {}}
