Sliding doors (shoji \u969c\u5b50) have one layer of thin, translucent paper instead of a glass. Thick doors (fusuma \u8956) are also made of multiple layers of paper, painted or printed on the surface. We revisit the principle behind this paper usage, tracing back into the indigenous Shinto religion where white paper was both the invitation (suki \u900f\u304d) and hinderance (sahari \u969c\u308a) of spirit. The paper infuses light, vibrates with the wind and absorbs moisture. Japanese traditional architecture is composed by multiple layers of transparent, thin, open materials such as rattan blinds (misu \u5fa1\u7c3e), paper doors (shoji), veil (cho/tobari \u5f35/\u5e37) and folding screens (byobu \u5c4f\u98a8). These layers creates the sense of depth (oku \u5965) that one can vaguely see through. The inside and outside are enfolded, not clearly separated. In light of this conceptualization of space, we can rethink the taken-for-granted style of subjectivities and practices.\u201d\n\u2013 Yutaka Yamauchi & Ko Kado\n\nYutaka Yamauchi is Professor at Kyoto University, Graduate School of Management, with joint appointments at Design School and Graduate School of Economics.
