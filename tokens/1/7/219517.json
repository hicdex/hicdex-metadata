For decades the television we all grew up with has been used to not only spread misleading propaganda but has become a great distraction to society. To each their own if indulging in front of a TV is what you prefer to do with your life but for those who are tired of feeling voiceless, this TV is for you.\n\nA distribution of $TV token has begun to be dispersed amongst the artist community within the Tezos network, through the help of me and a few rockstars.\n\nThis is a call to all artists, or any creatures up for the challenge.\nCredit for TV goes to Animattic, go follow for great art & support Twitter: @ANIMAttic \n\nPROPOSAL:Take this picture template of this TV nft(you don't have to buy,copy&pasta is permitted) and through your own creative self and your darndest effort possible, share a cause, a message, a concern that you feel should be addressed. It can be as creative or as simple as words, I want you to use this template as a microphone. Your voice matters, you deserve to be heard. \n\n\nOBJECTIVE: To raise awareness, gain exposure, to open dialogue and to give others a chance to speak about some real shit they feel passionate about through art.\n\nHOW IT WILL WORK:\nEvery month, the collective participants will put into vote using the $TV tokens which TV deserves more recognition, it will be narrowed down to 12 finalist, then the final 4, the winner with most votes by the most $TV token will be given a spotlight \nBut winners will also receive an LP boost through the TV/xtz LP pair which they can do as they will. And we will do this every month, for as long as we can. \n\nTo earn more $TV coin I created a farm on the crunchy network.\n\nhttps://app.crunchy.network/#/farms?q=Gonz\n\n$TV TOKEN SUPPLY:\n23.93 MILLION TV total tokens have been minted.\n\n16 million of those have been placed into the farm. Farming TV ends 11 of November, 11/11/2021 \n\nThis is a big trust fall, but I hope this brings a lot of fun while at the same time, giving people a platform to be heard. \n\n\nSIDE NOTE ABOUT THIS TV NFT:\nAnyone is free to take this image, without pay but anyone who buys this, I will \nAdd all of it to the TV liquidity, making the LP community funded. Together even a .1 can add up over time.\n\nTo learn more about this project and the $FAMM incentives, check out the $GONZ announcement channel on telegram \nDoctagonz presents: $GONZ\nhttps://t.me/doctagonz_official\n\nAnd come hang out with us at the GONZ chat group\n\nDoctagonz present's: $GONZ (chat)\nhttps://t.me/doctagonz_chat", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVF9pabbF8soM8Jf28k9EyPYFEFJRbTE28ewRfv3vMwNz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUwg8H6zAJVBKXcpG2gQtm7F8wx5L9yrJHFx366nh7FZd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVF9pabbF8soM8Jf28k9EyPYFEFJRbTE28ewRfv3vMwNz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2L4t9S9LjpR2ca6B869siiKe2Ymp3aQ4gg"], "tags": ["fammdoctagonztwistedvizualsthetvprojecttv"], "extra": {}}
