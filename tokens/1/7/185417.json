{"__version": 1, "token_id": 185417, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Arrakis", "description": "A desert planet with no natural precipitation, in Dune it is established that Arrakis had been \"His Imperial Majesty's Desert Botanical Testing Station\" before the discovery of melange, for which it is the only natural source in the universe. Melange (or, \"the spice\") is the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe, as it extends life and makes safe interstellar travel possible (among other uses). The planet has no surface water bodies, but open canals called qanats are used \"for carrying irrigation water under controlled conditions\" through the desert. The Fremen collect water in underground reservoirs to fulfill their dream of someday terraforming the planet, and pay the Spacing Guild exorbitant fees in melange to keep the skies over Arrakis free of any satellites which might observe their efforts. As indicated by its large salt flats, Arrakis once had lakes and oceans; Lady Jessica also notes in Dune that wells drilled in the sinks and basins initially produce a \"trickle\" of water which soon stops, as \"if something plugs it\".\n-\n\nPiece created through machine learning.
