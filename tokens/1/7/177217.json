It is known as the fly agaric for its ability to kill houseflies when combined with milk. The reason for this is that flies are attracted to the milk because it is so sweet. When they drink the milk they feel the effects of the mushroom and begin to get intoxicated.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcrB1GKtZdr3ypokHsbF63x9pc9k66iTma4oRZqNCda6v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcrB1GKtZdr3ypokHsbF63x9pc9k66iTma4oRZqNCda6v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcrB1GKtZdr3ypokHsbF63x9pc9k66iTma4oRZqNCda6v", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
