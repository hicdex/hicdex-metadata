I'm even more fortunate to live near the only leisure pier left in Kent. \n\nWalking under the pier the intertwining shapes go this way and that as the dark pillars angle against the colours of the sunrise. As the sun rises the sea settles and shimmers. A moment of peace before the day begins.\n\nI love the abstract shapes the pillars holding up the Pier make against the horizon. Everyday is different because so much changes, the tides, the clouds, the sunrise. Always something different, and occasionally the sun is red!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeie4l4s5yhcqmav6frxthraxuwyrpmbnhuju7pfgwviq5qag5jbnom", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreig6tbhhnbwlfkq275jiqexy55c7fmgy6qvgcec67mbrwsdwgyvrxe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeie4l4s5yhcqmav6frxthraxuwyrpmbnhuju7pfgwviq5qag5jbnom", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["sunrise", "pier", "red", "painting", "StephanieFuller", "watercolor"], "extra": {}}
