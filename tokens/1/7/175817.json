When you thought you'd run out of power you just continued the cycle.The drive got its name because it's function was based around the core concept of the wave nature of the universe. Because everything is vibrating at a different frequency, energy can be used and carried by these frequencies. It allowed the ships to store their energy for a longer period of time than they would normally have, they could have half a reactor, if not more, on the ship.Also known as Triquetra drive because of it's distinct shape(trefoil knot).If the Triquetra is turned on, the drive rapidly consumes the Triquetra and there is no more fuel left. Because of that, it has to be turned on and off in intervals. | @atimtay | linktr.ee/atimtakus", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSY2oNn6h4gC29qEnZBzSXcauTVrwngYCKXrSANRRduA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQNWT6MdcEC24fSFwNYGpr8RJKB4H74MLCE2hQCUYvSpi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZgrY78zsf9VxGmuhdfQCw7ieCU9NsoQrYQpigfwvzReo", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSY2oNn6h4gC29qEnZBzSXcauTVrwngYCKXrSANRRduA", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1XvP1MfRgh6DbHhVXK5TTqKznV5MYCGoMv"], "tags": ["gpt", "scifi", "interactive", "atimtay"], "extra": {}}
