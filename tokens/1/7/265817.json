The opposite is also true: when you are in a bad situation, things will eventually improve.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeic7n543hdjl24zooxzil4ruititp37jvbbfdwhm4f3srdxsh4p65u", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreig3q2u6hmatur6howcmqjj5vjeddqeenn3lbzahgs6yf63xatu674", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeic7n543hdjl24zooxzil4ruititp37jvbbfdwhm4f3srdxsh4p65u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1enACDiHTRGsVwS9XxrXuiz84ZABdTtdkm"], "tags": ["ai", "tarot"], "extra": {}}
