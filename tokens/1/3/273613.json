Using Photoshop CC that I got from my mom, I was trying to explore something that I found on the internet. So hope you like the very first artwork that I shared back when I was very young.\n\n-Ridho (tandukuda)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeici2i55p7g43sdr3mvzybhy7kb7kf3fxxxido3dwpcorzquekgkje", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiefaueaiuxcg4yvwgaa67aptdixkrodvue4z6uyewe7kr6ugqc7li", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeici2i55p7g43sdr3mvzybhy7kb7kf3fxxxido3dwpcorzquekgkje", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ctJCrfqKXgQVpsgMhJGGu6BKrasMi6sgV"], "tags": ["2Dartwork", "digitalmanipulation", "abstract", "henosy", "green", "clouds", "watercolor", "color"], "extra": {}}
