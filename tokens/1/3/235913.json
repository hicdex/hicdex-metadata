Swargarohini derives its name from the legends associated with it from the hindu epic Mahabharata. In the final section of the epic, the Pandavas give up kingdom and travel northwards in the hope of reaching heaven. The peaks are said to be the stairway to heaven that was followed by Pandavas, but only Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandavas, is able to reach heaven. According to the legends it is believed that this is the only way one can go to heaven without dying. But the legends further gets complicated as many claim that the Pandavas had taken a route from the present town of Badrinath in the eastern part of Garhwal, Uttarakhand, which is very far apart from the Swargarohini peaks in Sankari range of western Garhwal. AHead of Badrinath, Mana and onwards to Satopanth Lake, one can see the Swargarohini Glacier ( no relation to Swargarohini peaks ) and Yudhishthira and the dog ( form taken by Yamraj ) had climbed the Swargarohini glacier to the top and not the Swargarohini peak", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZAuB3S9Vc3oLdCGF3YN3Zuj3JCFiSJujjo3NZbUzsRAa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVzqCehDPG4SqQLhKU6db5d9fUjAADgTEeow53ELBscss", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZAuB3S9Vc3oLdCGF3YN3Zuj3JCFiSJujjo3NZbUzsRAa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zt3CzVbnXn86n5MgxSfWdVcF9oWLXyfDB"], "tags": ["mountains", "black&white", "clouds", "stairway"], "extra": {}}
