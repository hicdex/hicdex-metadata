This is the direction my work usually takes. In this case, the \"Faded Women\" collection speaks of those loves, of those important people who passed through our lives, who left a mark and now only exist in our memory. I work digital painting on photography to try to capture the dreamlike sensation that the memory transmits in our life without forgetting the raw material of the real world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicmnnnzolnmnzl64xzzmuduhditpacevl7lncroqfc6vxltojumky", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigcrktcx2ps5pvqihjatio42b2lc67m4k6njcjfyi77yuztqhklxy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicmnnnzolnmnzl64xzzmuduhditpacevl7lncroqfc6vxltojumky", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Ub5tLUonaVFGMe4nFpb3Cy81jsKmFXGx6"], "tags": ["memorydreamlikenostalgiafantasticmelancholysurrealismfarewellfeminineloveglowbeautysexoblivionnudewomen"], "extra": {}}
