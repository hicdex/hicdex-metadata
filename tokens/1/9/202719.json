They didn\u2019t like that it eroded their perpetual state of forget. They didn\u2019t appreciate the way it carried their hatred from\ntheir organs and deposited it into their toilets.\n\nThey paid good money for their rot and wanted to cherish their descent into the cushion of an easy chair they\u2019d eventually die in.\n\nThey resented water because it wanted to fix what wasn\u2019t ready to be, because it prolonged their suffering, nourished instead of dismantled.\n\nIt represented an unnecessary disruption to an eternally altered existence. A bothersome substance that threatened what they loved.\n\nWe didn\u2019t like water because we didn\u2019t see any reason to clean our wounds and resented it for not healing something already ripe with infection. It clogged gutters on rainy days and filled homes with black mold which consumed wood and brick and skin and bone. It filled the polluted river that didn\u2019t deserve more filling and fed the clouds that didn\u2019t need feeding.\n\nIt deposited into the soil and was ignored by dying plants who were indifferent to growth.\n\nWe hated water because it flowed from our eyes and we didn\u2019t know why. It poured from our skin and saturated our sheets at night.\n\nWe were all drowning, but I don\u2019t think it was the water filling our lungs or collapsing our chests.\n\nPeople from my hometown didn\u2019t like water much.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYoWRXGoju2d4RuwngkPEiZZYoRD5PVr5aEvCp5LTrZLE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcHLLwHoQM9JwrbKQisAYDYNw9GyafLwxz9hPJknfkk4z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYoWRXGoju2d4RuwngkPEiZZYoRD5PVr5aEvCp5LTrZLE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LoS9bZpbEHRztqXTfbCvqXCKPAdGYLEUq"], "tags": ["diewiththemostlikes"], "extra": {}}
