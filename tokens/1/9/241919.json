Sprouts among golems.\nWith loving minds.\n\n\u00ab The word golem occurs once in the Bible in Psalm 139:16, which uses the word \u05d2\u05dc\u05de\u05d9 (golmi; my golem), that means \"my light form\", \"raw\" material, connoting the unfinished human being before God's eyes. [...] A golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales (for example, some versions of Che\u0142m and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and versions of the Brothers Grimm), such as the word em\u00e9t (\u05d0\u05de\u05ea, \"truth\" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (\u05d0) in em\u00e9t,  thus changing the inscription from \"truth\" to \"death\" (m\u00e9t \u05de\u05ea, meaning \"dead\").\u00bb\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXqYiAC64Hkjoteu3sqheEw344sCxhyEqvMRaTHWxFEi5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXqYiAC64Hkjoteu3sqheEw344sCxhyEqvMRaTHWxFEi5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXqYiAC64Hkjoteu3sqheEw344sCxhyEqvMRaTHWxFEi5", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1R55ETpvQmXE46DN1J2R8V7tGgggRUQK62"], "tags": ["\u05d0\u05de\u05ea", "sprouts", "love", "Hermogenes"], "extra": {}}
