{"__version": 1, "token_id": 209519, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "bamboo", "description": "\"bamboo\" is the 3rd song off my new beattape \"souls\" releaseing August 27, 2021. My friend Marlo and I created the beat using nothing but a synth drum. We crave low end, and this song is full of it. Get it onto your best stereo and close your eyes to drift into the low end. \n\nthe cover art was generated by AI using the text prompt \"bamboo souls\" and of course the AI first went to Pandas. Who else is the souls of bamboo? \n\nBop your head and enjoy the music. If you purchase this piece, hit me up on twitter @ryanartwalker and I will send you the album with high quality WAV files!
