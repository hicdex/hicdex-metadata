{"__version": 1, "token_id": 247219, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "symposium", "description": "The piece is/(NFT) set around a boy who was wrongfully convicted of a 1998 rape and murder. He was 21 years of age at the time and was three semesters away from completing his undergraduate medical degree. \n\nLocal journalist later discovered that the police had concealed evidence that points to another suspect, and a DNA testing that would rule him out as the accused.\n\nHe ultimately spent over 19 years in prison before being exonerated. In a TV interview, the mother of the boy kneeled wistful and groans at the sheer scandal that uncovered. The society and the press quickly turned away their contrition into sensational fury toward the law enforcement. \n\nWhat absurd amount would be enough to recompense the boy who is scarred for life? who was stripped of youth beyond price?\n\nThe sounds are generated and mangled using sampler and sequencer from a digital audio workstation.\n\nThe artwork is part of a collaboration with _du.ta_. It is a composite novel object merged using acrylic paintings and 3D graphics. The process of computerized simulation allows for infinite mutation of anamorphous space, triggering reflection on the present and future of digitally rendered forms.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf42bYeFiPu1pFRh5gebuJEEL1NJUco4M1RKp58eK2iEG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV96EWaodgL1nAhQ9sgcyCERZ3De9Vw7UYHegtC8T9Fpq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf42bYeFiPu1pFRh5gebuJEEL1NJUco4M1RKp58eK2iEG", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1cgELhV4CEkDwN19ei5Qw7cK6C94nXRLqs"], "tags": ["music", "sounddesign", "abstract", "nftasia", "nftindonesia", "gulfofmeru", "_du.ta_"], "extra": {}}
