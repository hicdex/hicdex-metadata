Just as in this Poem by the 7th Century Japanese Poet Hitomaro, Seagrass is used as a metaphor for the entanglement of lovers in the bond of the relationship they have formed.\n\nAlthough abstracted, you can see in this painting that the clouds are enveloped by the seagrass that lands on the beach where I live. Surrounding and entangling something ethereal, something not tangible....just like human emotion.\n\n\u201cIn the Sea of Iwami\u201d \u2013 By Kakinomoto Hitomaro\n\nIn the sea of Iwami\nThere amid the stones under sea\nGrows the deep-sea Miru weed;\nThere along the rocky strand\nGrows the sleek sea tangle.\n\nLike the swaying sea tangle,\nUnresisting would she lie beside me \u2013\nMy wife whom I love with a love\nDeep as the miru-growing ocean.\n\nBut few are the nights\nWe two have lain together.\n\nAway I have come, parting from her\nEven as the creeping vines do part.\nMy heart aches within me;\nI turn back to gaze \u2013\nBut because of the yellow leaves\nOf Watari Hill,\nFlying and fluttering in the air,\nMy wife waving her sleeve to me.\nNow as the moon, sailing through the cloud-rift\nAbove the mountain of Yakami,\nDisappears, leaving me full of regret,\nSo vanishes my love out of sight;\nNow sinks at last the sun,\nCoursing down the western sky.\nI thought myself a strong man,\nBut the sleeves of my garment\nAre wetted through with tears.\n\nEnvoys \n\nMy black steed Galloping fast,\nAway have I come,\nLeaving under distant skies\nThe dwelling place of my love.\n\nOh, yellow leaves\nFalling on the autumn hill,\nCease a while\nTo fly and flutter in the air,\nThat I may see my love\u2019s dwelling place!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSt4TQg1cRgTJio4TfP5CHFcmujEdMS3eBExmR8PYkU6U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPzUhKGooHW2js6en2FUxCeJqL38XCRD8zequdYttWZyV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSt4TQg1cRgTJio4TfP5CHFcmujEdMS3eBExmR8PYkU6U", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Seascape", "seagrass", "watercolor", "StephanieFuller", ""], "extra": {}}
