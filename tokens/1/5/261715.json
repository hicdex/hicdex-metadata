When he goes to bed he cast the cup out into the hall, and filled it wi' water flowing down the back of his neck.  And when Evening calls, his servants come running up  with wreaths upon their heads, and purple ribbons hanging down  the sides of their horses.\n\n\nHis eyes are like bullets, and his mouth like a fuse, and his thougths are like blazing stars. And his face is like a felon hiding  his dagger in his side. And servants bring forth oil from their cups, and fire from their fires, and wine flowing down the stai-lands. I recognize those eyes of mine, O my son, when I saw them in you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihbnk2z4y2qbp7nilkjulycy37yf3kru7pkdc4aeuux7czoxicl6e", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicwwny5srelp4tqsl4hivedtbxdx7cfnouacajiu7sxszbvffj774", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihbnk2z4y2qbp7nilkjulycy37yf3kru7pkdc4aeuux7czoxicl6e", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bchTMEsYtQLZCaRc713M5feyfxzPD87TM"], "tags": ["neural", "expressionism", "animatedpainting", "terror", "house"], "extra": {}}
