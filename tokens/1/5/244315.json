{"__version": 1, "token_id": 244315, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Hanged Man", "description": "\"The Hanged Man\" is a short story inspired on the tarot card and on this thinking of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real. It\u2019s about this man who sees himself stuck in a loop, wandering around trying to find out what\u2019s real, what\u2019s causing him this pain. But reality is a funny topic, because how can we know what is real and what's not? Do you think that he\u2019s crazy? Does his wife really exist? Does he live next to this strange house? We will never know. But what I want to know is: what do you think? Do you see yourself stuck in a loop too? Do you also question reality?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRowGZBuU4SrioTmDCteyqhTjHE6reYgty4vLBttWYV1s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVMhAmFZwhrKKuKvx1zxWonsV3ku9QeaK1u9sDqQPJRNH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRowGZBuU4SrioTmDCteyqhTjHE6reYgty4vLBttWYV1s", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1iD14omDk7T6Zhn2FseemYT1sr43fBJj5m"], "tags": ["pdf", "yasminsenzi", "shortstory", "poetry", "poem", "writing"], "extra": {}}
