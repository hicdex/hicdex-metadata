{"__version": 1, "token_id": 201916, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "PixelFem #11 - Phil Bloom", "description": "On October 9, 1967, model Phil Bloom appeared naked on Dutch television show \"Hoepla\", marking the first time full nudity was shown on Dutch television. The nudity was in direct response to earlier criticism of Bloom, who had participated in an earlier episode of the show partially unclothed. This caused an outrage and in response, Bloom filmed a provocative follow up episode. Seven minutes into the episode, she appears sitting in a chair, naked, reading aloud a newspaper article criticising her earlier appearance. After Bloom finishes the article, she lowers the newspaper so that her entire (unadorned) body remains on screen for thirty-eight seconds. The address to which viewers could send complaints appears in the final seconds of the segment, superimposed over Bloom\u2019s image.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf2FUfHsp164ZK8FVxzs3cfpcDWK62hnG6iunae46QtQC", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb1QQAREH7GpTkbFy4zyKWXqi6m5zakFX3RRcTcWjfkwk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf2FUfHsp164ZK8FVxzs3cfpcDWK62hnG6iunae46QtQC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
