BLING-BLING! You bring, you bring me your soul: I\u2019ll craft you a vase or maybe a bowl.\n\n\u2028\u2028-LOOK AT THIS BOWL, A WONDERFUL BOWL, NOW GIVE ME A SMILE OR I\u2019LL SWAP IT FOR COAL!\n-But that was my child, now what should I do?\n-Rinse it with water and clean it with glue. \n\nNo blame! No shame! It\u2019s all for the show! Take from your friends and take from your foes. Building bridges with ribs that you bend, severed heads that with brooms you extend. \n\n\u2028\u2028-WE ARE BUYING, WE ARE BUYING! We are buying your sweat! You bet, you bet, of tears you are in debt. You better keep going until our will is met (and look at your neighbor I bet they\u2019re a threat).\n\n\u2028We shape our toys as we shape our dreams: we are architects, builders, right down to our genes. If you get no wood, bone\u2019s just as good: we use what we have, not what we should.\u2028\u2028\n\nTorture devices or wholesome machines? What will you choose and what will they bring?\n\nKILL COUNT: +7", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR9r7biUN5Rq987EEyq7UooP5UAQxka2gKhG1L26sviwp", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf6oEUTiMtgregE9iuZ2Vme7Jxn5b6TWG8qR4bMt2Vbu9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR9r7biUN5Rq987EEyq7UooP5UAQxka2gKhG1L26sviwp", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aQKoJYGJTZRNDjunJVuPmJeZPKsrRvpBZ"], "tags": ["blender", "3d", "story", "illustration", "color"], "extra": {}}
