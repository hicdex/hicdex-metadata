{"__version": 1, "token_id": 261016, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Twisted bow", "description": "The twisted bow is a reward from the Chambers of Xeric that requires a Ranged level of 75 to wield. It can fire any type of arrow, including dragon arrows. The twisted bow is extremely valuable due to its unmatched power against monsters with a high magic level, such as Commander Zilyana.  Similar to the crystal bow, the bow has an attack range of 10 tiles. As all attacks have a maximum of 10 range, long range does not provide any attack distance benefit but may still be used to gain Defense XP.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiayqhkcnirchieo22lh7joc32gtrsfzfz6dxmrudpwbysukzvkaem", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiayqhkcnirchieo22lh7joc32gtrsfzfz6dxmrudpwbysukzvkaem", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreiayqhkcnirchieo22lh7joc32gtrsfzfz6dxmrudpwbysukzvkaem", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iXfUmWwptpFQpLLSgmmVaotgjbdQAnTPT"], "tags": ["internaluseweb3"], "extra": {}}
