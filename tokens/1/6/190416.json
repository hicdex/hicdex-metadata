Transfer learning off rosinality\u2019s ffhq model.\n\n[gif description: Short animation morphs between two stylized portraits. Both femme people with their eyes fixed perfectly as the the black hair of the first transitions into a blue gray of the second. There are diamond patterns, characteristic of an undertrained alias-free gan model.]\n\nTools used: custom code, google colab, imagemagick\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT4NaMXPbXjQBbdPcotCmXM5DKGuaAx4JmSRhhXm9RgtU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT4NaMXPbXjQBbdPcotCmXM5DKGuaAx4JmSRhhXm9RgtU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT4NaMXPbXjQBbdPcotCmXM5DKGuaAx4JmSRhhXm9RgtU", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZJUhPGkPvBNSApBM3bQNwsB5soax4CJE8"], "tags": ["aliasfreegan", "mlart", "stylegan3", "googlecolab", "aiart", "neuralart"], "extra": {}}
