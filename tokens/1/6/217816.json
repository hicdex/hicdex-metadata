Through ArtOwly, these artists have switched on to a new platform exploring the world of NFTs.\n\nIn Ajay\u2019s work, he is shown as a person controlled by a toy. His artwork is set in the night, and the dark colour palette offers a grimy setting. The darker side of reality is explored through a change of vision. The visions we see through our eyes create a series of sensations, thoughts and images that occur in our minds. Accompanied by the mysterious background scores, his images create an air of occultism through their infinitely continuing visual loops. His artworks express the emotions he has gone through in a dream-like state.\n\nAjay Surendran is an artist based in Kerala. His lived experiences inspire his surreal 2D animation loops. He is currently pursuing his MVA in Painting from Raja Ravi Varma Centre of Excellence for Visual Arts Mavelikara. \n\n2D Animation / 1960x1920\n00:28 sec\nMP4\n\nView our exhibition at: https://artowly.com/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYULFqC2FE1rd1iNBGKmSKxZmzgeZtSGvcQgL282N4FAU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfF9U4edfAdGRR3GMss6qzCjgS2koK3nxChRAF537y6JS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYULFqC2FE1rd1iNBGKmSKxZmzgeZtSGvcQgL282N4FAU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2AfkJA16p4L1hmanKPv3eg6v7XepLknQJW"], "tags": ["Hoot_hoot", "Switch_on", "Darkart", "Occult", "2d", "Animation", "Surreal"], "extra": {}}
