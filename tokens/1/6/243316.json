Due to his wild personality, poetic lyrics, distinctive voice, unpredictable and erratic performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock history. Since his death, his fame has endured as one of popular culture's most rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the generation gap and youth counterculture.[3]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaaf4cwEE2uGcmhX9256TqAAByNEQ2M9AeHbdteyraPUR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbNGjh6Tr7Z5DfngABHrDoBU3TLywPW4Wh8JNhVBN9D3p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaaf4cwEE2uGcmhX9256TqAAByNEQ2M9AeHbdteyraPUR", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SpNeq7BXPTjhvynitfpLoNLTZZ1JFBsqg"], "tags": ["ABSTRACT", "GEOMETRIC", "COLORFUL", "TRIPPY", "LOOP", "ANIMATION", "PSYCHEDELIC", "OBJECT4OBJEKT", "MOTION", "EYEGASM", "OCTAINE", "GENERATIVE", "NOISE", "", "NFT", "NFTS", "NFTARTIST", "GLITCHART", "DARIUSHRAAD", "GENERATIVE", "CIRCLE", "creativecoding", "cleannft", "cryptoart", "particle", "interactive", "p5js", "TouchDesigner", "algorithmic", "processing", "python", "particle", "colourful", "infection", "PINK", "fluid", "hen200k", "objkt", "cleannfts", "Famous", "Portraits", "Dot", "JimMorrison"], "extra": {}}
