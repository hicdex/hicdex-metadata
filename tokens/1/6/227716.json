But I made a documentation with more personal approach, with hope to be different and interesting in visually. The most important thing is how the ideas behind the portrait uniform, can be communicate with good and easy to understood by the audience. The idea that I want to say is how I try to cover the faces of people behind the uniform, with objects that spontaneously and personally, I associate with these uniforms. I think uniforms have dominant image within social structure in Indonesia. And not just that, apparently uniform also very dominating to the person behind it, thus losing their existence as a person. We can say that they exist because of their uniform. In many ways, some people intentionally hide behind the uniform, to do things that harm the public.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNxBzED4bqTQ5P9SamSbro6udgmogv1JniHbRQuA44Fq4", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme7mGLZ6pCdMoQECtNHzXFHMR1G1DtKBAaMFpw1xRzjTG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNxBzED4bqTQ5P9SamSbro6udgmogv1JniHbRQuA44Fq4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Wu1VyW5C8cQCaPXWbnJ5NqPopiZysUyMD"], "tags": ["VisualArts", "Photography", "Portrait", "Jimbo"], "extra": {}}
