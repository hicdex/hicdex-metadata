{"__version": 1, "token_id": 278661, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Homage to Kawano", "description": "Interactive homage to the Markov chain-based work of Hiroshi Kawano (1925-2012), such as \"Design 3-1. Data 4, 5, 6, 6, 6\" (1964).\n\nDrag and drop an image file onto the canvas to pixelate it into a grid following a color palette from Kawano (in turn from Piet Mondrian). A probabilistic Markov Random Field model is then created of the image from the von Neumann neighborhoods (with a Manhattan distance of 1) of all the cells in the 40 x 40 cell grid. That is, cells are allowed to be determined by their closest neighbors to the left, top, right and bottom.\n\nKawano originally worked with Markov chain models of sequences of cells instead of their two-dimensional analogs, MRF, that are used here.\n\nCells in the grid are then replaced iteratively in accordance with the probabilities in the MRF model, in a process that I call Markovian drift.\n\nPress [V] to replace cells from left to right, [H] to replace cells from top to bottom, or [R] to replace cells in random order.\n\nPress [Space] or left click to pause. Press [Return] to reset to initial grid.\n\nOpen edition for 100 days.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYrpV1Px7jkkbMSFxzFU9i8c81i2abLDUDQKcTr43QKq4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR2S3bmsuoFv4p3fioUeEXTF9XS3eEESQHrqh3oLwjfnz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVmaSwrBr7WQbSKFxbNnQcvLnoLXZnSDHDnFDyb6x4vj1", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYrpV1Px7jkkbMSFxzFU9i8c81i2abLDUDQKcTr43QKq4", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WDJV8EC2WRegrn2W6A68RmZLyfZP8tzwJ"], "tags": ["interactive", "generative", "p5.js", "kawano", "markov", "pixels", "grid"], "extra": {}}
