{"__version": 1, "token_id": 216961, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Stratified [1 of 100]", "description": "This OBJKT evolves as it is traded. With each trade valued at 1+ Tez, there is the possibility of unlocking one or more new images (hereby referred to as states). Once additional states have been unlocked, previously unlocked states can be viewed by simply clicking on the OBJKT. The probability of unlocking different states is shown in the table below.\n\n  state  description    odds\n-------  -------------  ------\n   0001  1 cut          1/1\n   0002  2 cuts         1/2\n   0003  3 cuts         1/3\n   0004  4 cuts         1/4\n   0005  5 cuts         1/5\n   0006  6 cuts         1/6\n   0007  7 cuts         1/7\n   0008  8 cuts         1/8\n   0009  9 cuts         1/9\n   0010  20 cuts        1/20\n   0011  40 cuts        1/40\n   0012  60 cuts        1/60\n   0013  80 cuts        1/80\n   0014  100 cuts       1/100\n   0015  200 cuts       1/200\n   0016  300 cuts       1/300\n   0017  400 cuts       1/400\n   0018  500 cuts       1/500\n   0019  ???            1/1000\n\nTechnical details: The ophash for each valid trade (i.e. 1+ Tez) is deterministically converted to an integer x. For a state with odds 1/p to be unlocked one of the following conditions must be met: x % p == b for at least one valid trade; or p valid trades have occurred. One exception to this rule is that states must be unlocked in order.\n\nNB: You can hide the metadata in the bottom left corner by clicking on the text.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfYMyE4PNtd4f3vugvZfQb4UBLujSp2YkBWbW7wSXtSNE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNaq5X8nWnirCiSDfr7BoYiHSNvt8FkEqHtAfmhPWBC3P", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfYMyE4PNtd4f3vugvZfQb4UBLujSp2YkBWbW7wSXtSNE", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1QQtCX2FsrdupGLEteHeug2mBgVDuAZ6B6"], "tags": ["GENERATIVE", "MINIMALIST", "DIGITAL", "ABSTRACT", "INTERACTIVE"], "extra": {}}
