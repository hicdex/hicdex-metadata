H=N BLOCK celebrates the H=N Community, allowing multiple users to contribute to a multi-subjective & multi-objective collaborative whole, an open architecture of collaborative objects. These shared blocks are visible as long as a visitor is Here And Now. This ephemeral persistence allows for community design sessions, various user-generated content, curated live events, and variation through participation. This OBJKT is the Base form and connected to, upcoming Extensions of H=N BLOCK. \n _______Navigation__________\nMove (W/A/S/D), PlaceBlock(LeftMouseButton), DeletBlock(RightMouseButton, you can only delete your own Blocks), Animate(U), Pro Builder Mode(1/2/3/4/5/6/7)\n _________________\nH=N BLOCK by Alexander Grasser, 2021 \n@grasser_alex alexandergrasser.com #collaborativeobjects #realtimearchitecture ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRtit6CbTBdR6xpgbKSL1uw6nZvDFFDy427DHGBjZ3umA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXAjUQXCpFLG4KXVfWdomV5ZseyJvtqvuM5wFhWkJEGs4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXAjUQXCpFLG4KXVfWdomV5ZseyJvtqvuM5wFhWkJEGs4", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRtit6CbTBdR6xpgbKSL1uw6nZvDFFDy427DHGBjZ3umA", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1iZ9yHJzgvC4oBvHsrNmtL8GHPqtwqshAi"], "tags": ["architecture", "open", "architecture", "blockchain", "architecturemachine", "interactive", "realtime", "platform", "configurator", "creativecoding", "voxel", "block", "sharedownership", "commons", "monochrome", "CollaborativeObjects"], "extra": {}}
