In the book, the chivalrous, but crazy Don Quixote rides in to do battle with a group of giants who are terrorizing a local village. After he engages with the monsters he comes out of his trance and realizes he was actually fighting a windmill. The expression describes confrontations where the adversary is incorrectly perceived, or courses of action that are based on misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXcFiAxpDkCuhD1666kFa25zjain6dnPie8bMw8LEQncj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUVJ7A3ddjwcdbSZq9bT2XoMdSCSfBATGZ1dpVkrsTeNS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmUVJ7A3ddjwcdbSZq9bT2XoMdSCSfBATGZ1dpVkrsTeNS", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXcFiAxpDkCuhD1666kFa25zjain6dnPie8bMw8LEQncj", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1boNwhGdoPqWVVoxu92Ciznhrnnsk9ZoQF"], "tags": ["p5js", "artblocks", "generatearts"], "extra": {}}
