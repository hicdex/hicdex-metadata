I'd been hiking the day before and swimming most of the morning that day. So after drying off very quickly in the sun and chilling for an hour or so, I was about to go and play table tennis but noticed the heart shaped cloud and shot this photo. Hope you like it as much as I enjoyed that holiday.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPL9CeHzxULpWp6QkeRUSYTDRkZSGBn3gBtvpADxDC37K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYEMg939UQugz4y3ma1q2mfKQukyZeuohUvbiCgDwzhsy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPL9CeHzxULpWp6QkeRUSYTDRkZSGBn3gBtvpADxDC37K", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Xd3x8mbRMpmLeRGMfuRAHNYgWDim53BQh"], "tags": ["landscape", "nature", "horizon", "clouds", "sky", "lake", "france", "photo", "photography", "2d", "mountains", "colors", "white", "green", "blue", "trees"], "extra": {}}
