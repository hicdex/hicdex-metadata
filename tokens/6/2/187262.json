The Spring is usually a bit of metal pipe stuck into the crevice between two rocks in order to elicit a fairly gentle trickle, but one sufficient enough to fill a much-needed bottle of water. In the background are the mountains within the Slide Mountain Wilderness, an area of Catskill Park full of beautiful vistas and lush sub-alpine vegetation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcCdguofcMUiheVJwbs3Ja5wMmwaNovwaQTpihVxqjLoS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPViyKaUjVHDnTscHbEj16nDmWA6QmauUvwtQPExSqWuG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcCdguofcMUiheVJwbs3Ja5wMmwaNovwaQTpihVxqjLoS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Q3UPthREkbUPjKWKhvtbx2PZfXNCoxCBy"], "tags": ["nature", "mountains", "water", "Catskills", "countryside", "landscapephotography"], "extra": {}}
