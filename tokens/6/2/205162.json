My young self told himself to hold on to this thought until I would be in this moment in order to retrospectively be able to compare what I was imagining then and how it is truly. So as a memento to 9 year old me, I made this generated landscape background loop in After Effects and Trapcode TAO\u1d40\u1d39 to use as a background in the typography for the NFT I drop just prior to this one. \n\n05/01/2020\nA 4K 16:9 version of this animation was released on VJLoops.com\nhttps://www.vjloops.com/stock-video/raid2020-background-loop-01-155662.html\n\n07/01/2020\nA 4K 16:9 fullscreen version of the background filling the logo was released on VJLoops.com\nhttps://www.vjloops.com/stock-video/soft-landscape-09-155795.html\n\n \n13/08/2021\nminting this 1:1 | 1080x1080 | 270 FRAMES | 30FPS\nIn retrospect I don't think it as as bad as predicted by the game, surely much worse than I would have thought then...
