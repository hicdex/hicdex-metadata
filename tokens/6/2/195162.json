Music by husband Steve Fisk 2021 Photograph by Richard Nicol, Seattle \n\nAnne Grgich is one of the most original and innovative of the group of American artists known as Outsiders. Completely self-taught, and on the cover story of Raw Vision Magazine (#22), she became known for her one-of-a-kind books filled with page after page of impassioned, expressionistic faces and figures. Grgich often employs collage and vigorously applies layer after layer of overpainting, covering found texts and images, yet allowing some of the underneath to remain visible. This layering suggests generations of mystery and mystique to her exotic characters.\" -Phil Demise-Smith, Gallery A Studio, NY\n\nwww.annegrgich.com\n\nwww.instagram.com/annemariegrgich/\n\nwww.facebook.com/annegrgich\n\nhttps://rawvision.com/shop/raw-vision-22\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fisk", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcniXoQz6BZp2s55basufriAZBcauAPVLp3a3anJm1KVm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaeESBqUQJBfJ1zJ9s2wYMBvDcpdi7QdcM8b5WHHYb8F3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcniXoQz6BZp2s55basufriAZBcauAPVLp3a3anJm1KVm", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz2WWBPDBAjfagGSTCnVL8ZPRXnU7LGgjPoT"], "tags": ["#HEN#NFTCommunity#Cryptoart#Tezos#NFTartist#hicetnunc#nftcollectors#NFTArt#hicetnunc2000@onhicetnunc#NFTdrop#Crypto#cryptoartist#objkt#TEZ#1HEN1#HENP2P#nftcollector#Outsiderart#annegrgich#annemariegrgich#rawvisionmagazine#stevefisk"], "extra": {}}
