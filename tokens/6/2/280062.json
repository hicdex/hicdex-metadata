{"__version": 1, "token_id": 280062, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - Cartesian Grid Stitching 04", "description": "Unfolding of a lattice obtained through graph algebra operations from basic primitives (path graphs) with node removal. Lattice is transformed into a regular Cartesian grid by adding back the missing nodes. Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras.\n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 400 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifh233cpt4d44dw3hs32hzikw5uxqrzjsmkezqtu5o2z3puw7fr3m", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiani647edi2frcqo5tbdks5nsgeighsezcltuspfnmjv44focsgka", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifh233cpt4d44dw3hs32hzikw5uxqrzjsmkezqtu5o2z3puw7fr3m", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra"], "extra": {}}
