Created and minted 15/08/2021. This cave is the first in the series combining Generative Art techniques I created in 2012-2015 with the AI system I coded for the caves. This piece marks a significant milestone in the direction of this project and builds upon nine years of work. The Cave Paintings are produced by a custom neural network system that projects visions onto imaginary caves in response to prompts chosen by the artist.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbGQrUonAW94GqaMsMvkkxbQ77QArcMwKz5P7jPw25dzr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR1inejHt14NdZn2sY9JxLFSHLnrQ8pDFRLJBP7tadFoS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbGQrUonAW94GqaMsMvkkxbQ77QArcMwKz5P7jPw25dzr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gweZ5MNRidncb2TS1Vyy63ZqwGhVwPiQm"], "tags": ["Plummer-Fernandez", "CavePainting", "AI", "ML", "GenerativeArt", ""], "extra": {}}
