It's dated to the 16th century and written in Qatzijob'al, the language of the K'ich\u00e9 people).\n\nIn the Popol Vuh, he and other \"death bats\" inhabited Zotzi Haa' (\"The House of Bats\"), one of the realms of Xibalba (\"Place of Fear\", the underworld) which the protagonists of the story, the Kaib Kajolab (\"two boys\", Hunahpu & Xbalanque, more commonly referred to as \"the Hero Twins\"), had to cross through.\n\nThe Kama Zotz' was one of the hardest trials, accompanied by a legion of bats with razor bladed claws, hooks, wings, snouts and fangs. One of the Hero Twins was decapitated, but later resurrected. There are many different species of bats in Guatemala, the traditional region of the K'ich\u00e9 people.\n\nDrawing, Illustration and animation by Zamahel\nlinktr.ee/zamahel\ntwitter.com/itzamahel\ninstagram.com/itzamahel", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdS8cDwMnXLT8dRVMs2eTWgXGbj3QaFe2sNQLC3gSaDiK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdS8cDwMnXLT8dRVMs2eTWgXGbj3QaFe2sNQLC3gSaDiK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdS8cDwMnXLT8dRVMs2eTWgXGbj3QaFe2sNQLC3gSaDiK", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1eFB4QTvmxTsVetkQFdtjBkPnDpYaSsbGT"], "tags": ["bat", "morcego", "maya", "guatemala", "2danimation", "animation", "animated", "illustration", "drawing", "brazil", "popolvuh", "brasil", "indigenous", "culture", "cultura", "mythology", "batman", "characterdesign"], "extra": {}}
