It is used for several purposes, most often to mark the end of a declarative sentence (as opposed to a question or exclamation); this sentence-terminal use, alone, defines the strictest sense of full stop.\n\nIn Anglophone countries, it is used for the decimal point and other purposes, and may be called a point. In computing, it is called a dot.It is sometimes called a baseline dot to distinguish it from the interpunct (or middle dot). While full stop technically only applies to the full point when used to terminate a sentence, the distinction \u2013 drawn since at least 1897 \u2013 is not maintained by all modern style guides and dictionaries.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreid2vh6ndsfvfguygeuedrtqhzadntey6h23mh5zidl7wl4nqrrmpa", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidriwafooa6tlpwdvov5rvszxw4lnzacarzsqg6tibwx7rfcs2p2m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreid2vh6ndsfvfguygeuedrtqhzadntey6h23mh5zidl7wl4nqrrmpa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SFTiZRgGN9domin29qNxJG72ik71k2YpU"], "tags": ["Fullstop", "record", "hicetnunc", ""], "extra": {}}
