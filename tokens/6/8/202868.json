I redid it to remove the pasties from the first version at the North American Body Painting championships.\n\nThis was the first time I painted my logo of the Skull Dove (shown on her chest), which came to realization literally minutes before I painted it for the competition. This body painting was instrumental in me taking the competition win that weekend.\n\nWar and Peace, Positive/Negative, Red and White. Using only two main colors, White as Purity, Red as War. It's all about opposites. On the competition piece you can see Gandhi and a floral pattern balanced opposite Hitler and an atomic bomb cloud. An Escher-esque blend of doves shift into tanks on her back. In the camouflage, there is a hint of helicopters in the red.
