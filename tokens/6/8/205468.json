After graduating from college, she applied for a teaching license but was rejected by the New York City board of education, which called her a fire hazard. Heumann sued for discrimination and won in a landmark case, becoming the first wheelchair user to teach in the city\u2019s schools. That victory put Heumann in the spotlight. She founded her own disability-rights group in 1970 and went on to become an iconic advocate for the independent-living movement.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUvSsWBHpiC2qVWBNc99bP1ACTUVySy6YbTM6tEeYqHYy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQFVfA9dXXKF8oWsD9TJ7mGREq8evsS14Tp3aatxqHyzr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUvSsWBHpiC2qVWBNc99bP1ACTUVySy6YbTM6tEeYqHYy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
