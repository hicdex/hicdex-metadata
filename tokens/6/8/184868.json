This one is called Knightmare. I remember the Tower of Terror stood here when I used to come here. A rollercoaster that looped around a faux castle, with a hidden loop-the-loop inside. The first time I ever went upside down on a rollercoaster (not knowing this was going to happen when I started the ride!)\n\nMp4 | 1080x1080 pixels| July  2021\n\nhttps://www.obsidianurbexphotography.com/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYV4nLkwdXkMEJhvwdoVg126fUqDcmwLa6GDXhjATpGa3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVqLAGC8dgijtV4smGpgNtW5HgQiG1xRWjKgrUJVqXb2u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYV4nLkwdXkMEJhvwdoVg126fUqDcmwLa6GDXhjATpGa3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Wu77PvNTw3ZSCfnwffz6xMtMiUdFLdjm4"], "tags": ["abandoned", "urbex", "urbanexploration", "obsidianurbex", "glitch", "photography", "themepark", "janinependleton"], "extra": {}}
