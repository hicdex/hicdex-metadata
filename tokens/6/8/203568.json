But now with text prompts guiding the artistic creation, it puts the artist back in the picture, and the results always feel very human and expressive.\n\nThis piece is from a collection of 4 I made using the text prompt 'Artificial Imagination'.\n\nI've been using VQGan from the very first day it was implemented, so I hope this piece represents something historical, as well as my own personal journey and beginnings in this new art movement.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSeqACPJtNaVpHoiVj9FPUSQru9iDdMehHhbtkJizi2xL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUoRca99RQv53GCGq7gAc1JRbTWoZ5cT1FTheuwDqRc9r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSeqACPJtNaVpHoiVj9FPUSQru9iDdMehHhbtkJizi2xL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XqPwDdQdGrL6u1LAwjCksCDUpPXVjRJZp"], "tags": ["ai", "aiart", "vqgan", "clip", "machinelearning", "generative", "GlennIsZen", "surreal", "surrealism", "ganart", "generativeart", "abstract", "computerart", "digitalart", "art", "metaphysical", "spiritual", "nature", "future"], "extra": {}}
