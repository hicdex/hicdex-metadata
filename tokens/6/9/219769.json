All profits from primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.\n\nColors were sampled and placed on canvas from pixels of a public domain photograph of Marilyn Monroe, from the trailer for the film \u2018Niagara\u2019 in random sized ellipses and rects.\n\nBackground color palevioletred #CA568F sampled from Marilyn\u2019s dress. Further random noise added of ellipses and rects in white, black, rosybrown (#A88387), dimgray (#6E5F57), palevioletred (\u2018#CA568F\u2019), red '#FF0000', green '#00FF00', blue '#0000FF\u2019]. Dimgray, paleviolet red and rosybrown were sampled from the image. Basic primary colors of red, green and blue added to hint at a faked glitch affect.\n\nAfter 5 frames, the method adding colors from the image of Marilyn altered to add only shapes in palevioletred for two frames.\n\nVideo represents seven frames from one cycle of the sketch.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXcoM7YhzbgJVDw4ENN6xcPDbzTKFPhuM1syggjDjmQzq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWvaQBMhZnSSNiPtRurwzAFPF2YeZ1eGCej8CsPUiu2v7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXcoM7YhzbgJVDw4ENN6xcPDbzTKFPhuM1syggjDjmQzq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iejkdRYyq7WdVtrXgpq1dtazsGpthkF1U"], "tags": ["P5js", "generative", "generativeart", "pop", "popart", "Marilyn", "Monroe", "marilynmonroe", "sketchforprocessing"], "extra": {}}
