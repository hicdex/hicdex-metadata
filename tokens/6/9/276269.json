That according to their fables and tales, this being has the ability to be transformed into a Wolf.\n\nAccording to reports, even though his body is fully in a Wolf form, he doesn't lose his sanity, on the contrary, he gets smarter. He detects distant scents, with or without his wolf form. Some fables say that it was the goddess Jacy herself who gave him these abilities. He has a sacred spear made with guarana juice capable of exploding stars. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiatqhstotd3ffa6jdtj3t3pgmp7gml3wv54v4ce7uzhds6p73ulc4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeievd7shuag6jof4jbzettg4zduwj5tk5p77q477ssdrrshubbwgpy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiatqhstotd3ffa6jdtj3t3pgmp7gml3wv54v4ce7uzhds6p73ulc4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["cryptolegends", "demon", "nature", "florest", "brazil", "monster", "loboguara", "wolf"], "extra": {}}
