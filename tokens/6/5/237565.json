I find that different photography exercises and experiments can do this work very well for me. a few weeks ago when I read an article about the \u201cPetzval lens\u201d I remembered the \u201cfreelensing\u201d \u2013 a very interesting technique that everyone can try and implement with his existing gear.\n\nFor freelensing i love to use Asahi fully manual 50mm f/1.4 M42 Bayonet lens. M42 bayonet is the most suitable for freelensing because of the suitable distance between the rear glass and sensor of the camera, which allows to find and capture very sharp focused fields. the secret is to not attach the lens to the body of the camera but to hold it in hand very close to the front of the sensor. the effect is stunning, the leaks of light just violate all laws of classical photography, the vignetting is natural and there is no software that is able to recreate it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR1fhutfxLXKM25zh52TVFY4e9XQ4SUJRBDdFnuXiyfYY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbGdpTswwdRsm97NCPrA2xtoNocK5pkM4p2aTTTRN7uYT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR1fhutfxLXKM25zh52TVFY4e9XQ4SUJRBDdFnuXiyfYY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gSNiWQxVNxzqBinE7N36rzYDZzugVrq1f"], "tags": ["photography", "freelensing", "freestyle", "Asahi", "manuallens", "unattachedlens", "colors", "Art", "style", "water", "splash", "lightleak", "lensflare"], "extra": {}}
