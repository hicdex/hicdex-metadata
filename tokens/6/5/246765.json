Part of exploration of space.\n\n'Kawalan'(nothingness) is the term used by the creator to define the word 'Space'. He started exploring the space in 1997. We see a space as if it is empty or nothing's in there. But for sure, that's not the reality of the creator. \n\nSome strips may lookalike but in every space, the creator guaranteed that there will be no totally identical strips/pieces. Like humans living in this space. Every existence has its own color, shape, aura, and beauty!\n\n\nLegend says these pieces can uplift your auras and help you to align yourself from within to your roots.   \nCan be a bluff, but these works help the creator when it comes to alignment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcqGHEm9Qsb4se5uZc58FGXoCvuZGar66h2h8sWPJUWFQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcqGHEm9Qsb4se5uZc58FGXoCvuZGar66h2h8sWPJUWFQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcqGHEm9Qsb4se5uZc58FGXoCvuZGar66h2h8sWPJUWFQ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Nd5AAVZt3LBN1UkotpFnukwqFgVwHJHjo"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "jakestudyos", "psychedelicart", "EXPLORATIONOFSPACE"], "extra": {}}
