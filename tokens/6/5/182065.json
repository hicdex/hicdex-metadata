It was at the end of the 19th century, in Dublin, when I met Oscar. He was a rebellious adult and meeting me changed his life. We just prefered smoking marijuana and and having sex than going out to chase the neighbors. The neighbors also thanked me. Oscar and I enjoyed it a lot and he even gave me a few kisses. It turned out that people saw him hanging out with some men, and this gave him a major problem. Oscar was too modern for those boring people. After that day, we just met again in hell. He's having so much fun there and I'm still his drug dealer; after all, I show up in hell all the time.
