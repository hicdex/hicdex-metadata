This series tells the story of my photography genesis, as this feels right to me. These animated images tell the story of my first exploration adventure, revisiting the now-abandoned theme park I used to love as a child.\n\nPart 3 of 7 // A brief moment and I look left, the light is poking through the trees. Glorious light rays illuminate the track. I click my shutter and I preserve the moment in time. Then the light rays dissolved again. This is my favourite memory of the day.\n\nMp4 | 1080x1080 pixels| July  2021\n\nhttps://www.obsidianurbexphotography.com/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNuTecywXFEPvnWtoumNUbZocppBW6TeknCxyShga5623", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcEMCPWigVVJQ5C4hpqU6ERp4tfcRUZZRtwRHFKJgqWkR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNuTecywXFEPvnWtoumNUbZocppBW6TeknCxyShga5623", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Wu77PvNTw3ZSCfnwffz6xMtMiUdFLdjm4"], "tags": ["abandoned", "urbex", "urbanexploration", "obsidianurbex", "glitch", "photography", "themepark", "janinependleton"], "extra": {}}
