Dozen of these turquoise channels gently meander, intertwining, creating a perfect retreat to float along in the balmy sunshine.\nIt is further accentuated by the sweet spiced floral notes from the Onwa flower that bury roots into any opportune crevice in the rocks. Blue Poinma flowers float in the water, using air filled leaf bladders drifting with the gentle breeze.\n\nYou may also be lucky to see one of the smaller Airdiors created for the people by a kindly old man from Iridias as a gift, as this world is devoid of avian creatures. The people had given him refuge following the devastating drought on his homeworld. These tiny ones seem to have become more musical in their gentle hum lately, making any sighting an even more blissful outing.\n\n4050 x 3240 PNG", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaxg7Qbek8pSgkHrYv91DQWwEr33WPMT2bm2J52UfeH3V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZQdRrYcrHrUei6jrhyxJbyXUV3tzS9keJ7iQX89UydBx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaxg7Qbek8pSgkHrYv91DQWwEr33WPMT2bm2J52UfeH3V", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2JJH37cQ7t77KDZV8VSsdhDZss8mtmSnHY"], "tags": ["tropical", "3dart", "scifiart", "sciencefiction", "blenderart", "conceptart", "digitalartwork", "turquoise", "sunny", "retreat", "relax"], "extra": {}}
