{"__version": 1, "token_id": 230964, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Moving valleys", "description": "A valley is an elongated low area often running between hills or mountains, which will typically contain a river or stream running from one end to the other. Most valleys are formed by erosion of the land surface by rivers or streams over a very long period of time. Some valleys are formed through erosion by glacial ice. These glaciers may remain present in valleys in high mountain or polar areas. At lower latitudes and altitudes, these glacially formed valleys may have been created or enlarged during ice ages but are now ice-free and occupied by streams or rivers. In desert areas, valleys may be entirely dry or carry a watercourse only rarely. In areas of limestone bedrock, dry valleys may also result from drainage taking place underground rather than at the surface. Rift valleys arise principally from earth movements, rather than erosion. Many different types of valley are described by geographers, using terms that may be global in use or else applied only locally.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8DMyDWxDKcKkny8ksJoNfyZB3WvE7sd15M3oW4dGV5r", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRRUfNvpVbBBPLRQYHja15w4Vigf3NUVwJ6SGrEa21u4b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb8DMyDWxDKcKkny8ksJoNfyZB3WvE7sd15M3oW4dGV5r", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YbyApTWfc4kC2enncY5S4cUAga753aAkK"], "tags": ["henpro", "hen200k", "hicetnunc", "hicetnunc200", "tezos", "tezosart", "nftcollection", "art", "nftart", "nftcollector", "cleannfts", "3d", "3dmotion", "digitalart", "colorfull", "3dart", "motion", "nft", "cleannfts", "infection", "nfts", "parviz", "cryptoart", "algorithmic", "octaine", "eyegasm", "animation", "geometric", "leaf", "creativecoding", "processing", "cleannft", "touchdesigner", "colourful", "particle", "psychedelic", "subtle", "motion", "circle", "colorful", "generative", "objkt", "jungle", "loop", "interactive", "hen200k", "object4objekt", "abstract", ""], "extra": {}}
