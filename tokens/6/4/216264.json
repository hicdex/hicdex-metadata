TEGEN is a blockchain miner and she loves nothing better to visit blockchains and attach NFTs to them. She does have a strange way of charging for her services by pressing her gas fee button in between her eyes with gives out a random fee which can either be virtually free or very expensive. She has no control over this apparently but she does have one of the biggest mansions in the URCORNYVERSE, a fleet of rainbow helicopters and a swimming pool full of her mining friends having back-to-back mining pool parties.
