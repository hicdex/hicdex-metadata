The interactive tool was made in 2001 and set the mood for many a rave! The modern recreation has a treat... press the edit icon and adjust the curve using ZIM built-in Bezier Blobs! \n\nThis is an iconic editable work of art from Dr Abstract, the Founder of ZIM, and inaugural member of the Gadget Minters. With Opartica 2 (Tunnel), thousands of op art patterns were made and may become a future collectable series. \n\nCollect the original Opartica NFT and enjoy its wonder!
