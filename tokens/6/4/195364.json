The small marks on the corner and middle of the poster are due the sticker tape used to exhibit it. No rips or heavy flaws. \nThis is a completely grail for those who like Evangelion Posters.\n\nProbably the first vintage poster being sold as an NFT. This piece includes the real physical poster.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd6BYHdjeXfeSFZYwodj2xFws3KjbUtnQ6QNszjVDZvQ3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd6BYHdjeXfeSFZYwodj2xFws3KjbUtnQ6QNszjVDZvQ3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd6BYHdjeXfeSFZYwodj2xFws3KjbUtnQ6QNszjVDZvQ3", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Xys62S4ZGYNvWG9maXtB2AfwHuMb3LdTf"], "tags": ["evangelion", "vintage", "1997", "anime", "physical", "nostalgia", "gainax", "eva", "neon", "genesis"], "extra": {}}
