The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. :: Procedural Symbols #68/1000", "description": "Created by tz1R6mtcAQwBTK9YpSqRL9y2a6JZWgDkBm6M on 26 August 2021 at 10:11:46 AM :: Generated procedurally at art-o-matic.xyz", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmameE36rwswxEQCf6UV53kqsopD3Tprtv6km9rG1UPzHy?seed=The%20FitnessGram%E2%84%A2%20Pacer%20Test%20is%20a%20multistage%20aerobic%20capacity%20test%20that%20progressively%20gets%20more%20difficult%20as%20it%20continues.%20The%2020%20meter%20pacer%20test%20will%20begin%20in%2030%20seconds.%20Line%20up%20at%20the%20start.%20The%20running%20speed%20starts%20slowly,%20but%20gets%20faster%20each%20minute%20after%20you%20hear%20this%20signal.%20%5Bbeep%5D%20A%20single%20lap%20should%20be%20completed%20each%20time%20you%20hear%20this%20sound.%20%5Bding%5D%20Remember%20to%20run%20in%20a%20straight%20line,%20and%20run%20as%20long%20as%20possible.%20The%20second%20time%20you%20fail%20to%20complete%20a%20lap%20before%20the%20sound,%20your%20test%20is%20over.%20The%20test%20will%20begin%20on%20the%20word%20start.%20On%20your%20mark,%20get%20ready,%20start.", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYY6QGeCsGD89qSpx4TPU8EgaAevub4VTacRZNmAehcA3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmYY6QGeCsGD89qSpx4TPU8EgaAevub4VTacRZNmAehcA3", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmameE36rwswxEQCf6UV53kqsopD3Tprtv6km9rG1UPzHy?seed=The%20FitnessGram%E2%84%A2%20Pacer%20Test%20is%20a%20multistage%20aerobic%20capacity%20test%20that%20progressively%20gets%20more%20difficult%20as%20it%20continues.%20The%2020%20meter%20pacer%20test%20will%20begin%20in%2030%20seconds.%20Line%20up%20at%20the%20start.%20The%20running%20speed%20starts%20slowly,%20but%20gets%20faster%20each%20minute%20after%20you%20hear%20this%20signal.%20%5Bbeep%5D%20A%20single%20lap%20should%20be%20completed%20each%20time%20you%20hear%20this%20sound.%20%5Bding%5D%20Remember%20to%20run%20in%20a%20straight%20line,%20and%20run%20as%20long%20as%20possible.%20The%20second%20time%20you%20fail%20to%20complete%20a%20lap%20before%20the%20sound,%20your%20test%20is%20over.%20The%20test%20will%20begin%20on%20the%20word%20start.%20On%20your%20mark,%20get%20ready,%20start.", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1R6mtcAQwBTK9YpSqRL9y2a6JZWgDkBm6M"], "tags": ["Sh!g", "art-o-matic", "proceduralart"], "extra": {}}
