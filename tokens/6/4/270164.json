He did not teach me anything about photography technique or about composition, rule of thirds or exposure triangle, he taught me to trust my vision and sensitivity, even when I was completely lacking photography skills. That\u2019s why I call him mentor.\n\n\u201cAar\u00f3n, you have a great sensitivity, keep doing photography, the world needs your vision.\u201d \nSadly, Gorka committed suicide about five years ago. When that happened, I got to know that he put their first camera in the hands of many people. He was a cheerful person and had a life we could call \u201csuccessful\u201d. But even with all that, he could never overcome the pain coming from the feeling that his parents never loved him. \n\nMuch of the beauty and evolutive positivity that I transmit with my photography, is only possible because Gorka trusted me. If you are reading this, I want to tell you \u201cPlease, trust yourself, we need your vision\u201d. \ud83d\udc9a\n\n\nFractal from original photography.
