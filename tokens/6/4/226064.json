{"__version": 1, "token_id": 226064, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Stutter [Ticket]", "description": "Stutter is a generative audio-visual artwork with 10 1/1 unique editions. When this OBJKT is burned, a unique 1/1 OBJKT (1500 x 1500 mp4) is generated using the wallet address and hash of the burn operation as a seed for the generation process. Once the new OBJKT has been generated, it is minted and transferred to the wallet who initiated the burn operation. The royalties on the generated OBJKT will be the same as this OBJKT. This video is an example generated using a random seed. Since generating a single OBJKT takes about ~50 compute hours, there will be a waiting period before the generated OBJKT is transferred in your wallet.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPXRRDq8ySNUat212qzbkMG5A8gb6hX2G2jK13EihVy49", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmekdXrcAnUg8iKgTLwvUZPHJd48FNF2NTAmJ4EvoSgLzP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPXRRDq8ySNUat212qzbkMG5A8gb6hX2G2jK13EihVy49", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RkYY3jr1ocuPdQqrRefr5FqoawKQsmBmD"], "tags": ["ABSTRACT", "MINIMALIST", "GENERATIVE", "AUDIO", "VIDEO"], "extra": {}}
