This combination recalls the exotic flavors from Amozon cuisine; as Ferran Adri\u00e0 says, \u201cthe last of the last frontier of gastronomy\u201d. This combination of fish and berry, can be served in a simple riverside peoples meal, but also presented in a contemporary fashion, like in Atala\u00b4s restaurant D.O.M. The Chef\u00b4s Kimbab, brings the freshness of fusion cuisine to the metaverse, mixing innovation and refinement to create unique dishes. This series follows Korean food philosophy with Brazilian ingredients and the elegant touch of The Philosopher's Bistro Brand, decorated with eatable golden leaves.
