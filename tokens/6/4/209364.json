We usually celebrate it, but we were all hit by a global pandemic, and the reality is grim in Indonesia, at least 118,833 deaths so far because of Covid. So I'm not sure what are we celebrating right now. Are we celebrating death?\n\nPS: Don't get me wrong, I'm proud to be an Indonesian. There's a lot to be proud of off Indonesia; the food, the people, the nature, and the list can go on and on.\n\n17845 x 17845 pixels\n76 ppi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWfK6LaH2DPdYF8cfsDyZeSAA2nTK8ZJDKuzAsVidVEsi", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme3wCZ1TnPkEgwQWq9M2An2MFbyPpza4KR4a7JwHfkNPX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWfK6LaH2DPdYF8cfsDyZeSAA2nTK8ZJDKuzAsVidVEsi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PPLJxtXQCE5J4rTLhyepqcw56PENBufry"], "tags": ["celebrating", "death", "digital", "collage"], "extra": {}}
