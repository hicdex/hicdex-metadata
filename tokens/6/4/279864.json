After 2 major surgeries and lots of LOVE & PRAYERS, I am back and I am strong.\nBeing bed ridden meant I couldn't move around alone and do basic self-care tasks, additionally I had to become comfortable with asking for help and letting others help me (this might have been the hardest part for me.)\n\nIt was clear to me that humans are not meant to be alone or isolated, and that it's our shared connections that empowers us the most. I wrote this poem for the people who accompanied me on this healing journey, I could not have done it without you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiftdlanlan6d5qa6seta3n2bibfpkxcr3ygj6rnzp2ti25typehdy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiedfe3r2xyzmexkbphq2v6kmicfzdxmyse4sheu74vrlmpffnuawi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiftdlanlan6d5qa6seta3n2bibfpkxcr3ygj6rnzp2ti25typehdy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dAKb5ntxNHCXxMhQTbvSGJW84y5S2Srwh"], "tags": ["Poetry", "Poems", "Family", "Love", "community", "sunrise", "love", "manifest", "blessings", "purpose", "gratitude", "healing", "sunset", "intentional", "rest", "selfcare", "wellness"], "extra": {}}
