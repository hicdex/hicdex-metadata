Published in 1972, the article discusses the various issues she had found with the feminist movement of the time, especially in the fields of lesbianism, childcare, and women's freedom. One of Ono\u2019s most important feminist works is her performance piece entitled Cut Piece, in which she sits on a stage dressed in a simple black dress and kneeling in the conventional way of sitting in formal situations in Japan. She places a pair of scissors in front of her on the floor of the stage and invites audience members, both male and female, to come to the stage individually, taking the scissors and cutting off one piece of Ono\u2019s garments.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP5nMKa6zRUpZdmHXD6ubXdrHMZ4z62z5rjVRKwGhGzMs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYAhTydbunrBkF6tF1txDum3yLd7bP7zjgKG6RTJW2mfh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP5nMKa6zRUpZdmHXD6ubXdrHMZ4z62z5rjVRKwGhGzMs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
