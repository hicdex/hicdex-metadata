What she did was write the world\u2019s first machine algorithm for an early computing machine - called the 'Analytical Engine' - that existed only on paper. Lovelace was a visionary: she understood that numbers could be used to represent more than just quantities, and a machine that could manipulate numbers could be made to manipulate any data represented by numbers. She predicted that machines like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, produce graphics, and be useful to science. Of course, all that came true - in another 100 years.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmShxJvSiBJzo5VnCLRmk35NF3pC7G5m5E6SWQFeua5abS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPhCb7xTUHefgPWAXmtc1yWEnt9CvbpbzaEXKExDtZitx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmShxJvSiBJzo5VnCLRmk35NF3pC7G5m5E6SWQFeua5abS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "adalovelace", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
