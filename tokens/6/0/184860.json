This series tells the story of my photography genesis, as this feels right to me. These animated images tell the story of my first exploration adventure, revisiting the now-abandoned theme park I used to love as a child.\n\nPart 2 of 7 // I remember this ride as a child. This was a children\u2019s rollercoaster, the car was shaped like a dragon. It used to take you on a level track in and out of the trees, a cute little ride. It was diesel-powered, and I remember the smell of the fumes.\n\nMp4 | 1080x1080 pixels| July  2021\n\nhttps://www.obsidianurbexphotography.com/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaFwpX1RKT961ZWTJBkWneMqvarC1m31tHbGHBmcq2bZe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTtKD5r6GnqkyQsauU1ndgu2B4J4b3rnnyhiBKYLCWYui", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaFwpX1RKT961ZWTJBkWneMqvarC1m31tHbGHBmcq2bZe", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Wu77PvNTw3ZSCfnwffz6xMtMiUdFLdjm4"], "tags": ["abandoned", "urbex", "urbanexploration", "obsidianurbex", "obsidianurbex", "glitch", "photography", "themepark", "janinependleton"], "extra": {}}
