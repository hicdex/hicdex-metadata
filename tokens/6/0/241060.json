Paulista in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, in the apocalyptic and chaotic context of the pandemic in Brazil. LIV is a reference to the time signature of the song, 5/4, in roman numbers. Energetic and odd to dance, this music goes well on a sunny day at the beach.\nThe process of creation and production was minimalist done, only with a laptop, a headset and a lot of research on musical theory. Inspired by the DIY culture, \"Furniture Songs\" shows that virtually anyone can create their sounds without the need for expensive and specific equipment and hard work.\n\nTrack: 2 of 6\nGenres: Chill-Out, Ambient, Lo-Fi\nMaster: Rodrigo Paschoal\nRelease Date: Apr 30, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYfP4vNpbJ8Zoxqktmiv6FrX3SbCosiR8qMNhGbMBM8of", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRdwn7dLVvseyWxS5gBLytegD4TeVBA2HBVWVXTFw5Sii", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYfP4vNpbJ8Zoxqktmiv6FrX3SbCosiR8qMNhGbMBM8of", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MM2wfCrRzGvXYTt1BsChqsACaF5SJQiVN"], "tags": ["music", "lofi", "chill-out", "sunnyday"], "extra": {}}
