I bring a reference of a video still into the VR program Gravity Sketch and use the reference to add lines and shapes to enhance/bring to life the original rescan. All reference images were made with video hardware/mixers with internal video feedback and rescanned off a CRT monitor with a digital camera. The Stills and Virtual Reality drawings are united together in Photoshop. \n\n2596 x 1830 pixels ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfSG8UePyjTDvmioVawNgZh9vMWVEP4TaadFqw3xabhzu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYcFWB5fXVFfunzW8qmqkdoazRFupJDvoJqFCP5BWEMt6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfSG8UePyjTDvmioVawNgZh9vMWVEP4TaadFqw3xabhzu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UiA3Nkg2Ugy2BPqorU7V5LPwCukK5wZd3"], "tags": ["vr", "vrart", "virtualreality", "videofeedback", "vrpainting", "mixedmedia", "abstract", "abstractart", "crt", ""], "extra": {}}
