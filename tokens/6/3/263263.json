Secondary sales will go to a cancer charity. If you don't like charity, grab a pixel out of support. We Will be posting receipts and tasteful proof of distribution to stay transparent.\n\nBack Story: 2019: I was diagnosed with cancer and went through surgery, radiation and chemo. The week after my treatments were completed my baby sister was also diagnosed and also did surgery, radiation and chemo. We were both blessed to have good outcomes. During my extensive treatment, I met so many people suffering. Sitting there drawing with chemotherapy dripping in my veins, I promised that when I got better I would make an art project to give back.\n\nRoadmap:\n\n1. Make Pixels\n2. Help People Struggling With Cancer.\n3. Go To Step 1\nFunds will be hand-delivered to patients that are suffering from cancer.
