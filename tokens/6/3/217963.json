Once fully deployed it has some of the most advanced tech allowing it to read atmospheric, weather, gravity and a myriad of other data to adjust to any planets condition. \n\nDepending on the conditions it will adapt to using jet-fuel, magnetic levitation, or hydro jets to propel itself around any given planet. An item for the ultimate space explorer.\n\nSpeed: +10\nArmor: +5", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXLbnSXTfFrNxQz6ED8t4MY7u1ttAhFmRjTV5JSDTsrMN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYzZx2EL1dFqfDSjQ71rSzGJhSZb92SLbCKZym78P29nD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXLbnSXTfFrNxQz6ED8t4MY7u1ttAhFmRjTV5JSDTsrMN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YtUbTURpWeX1CzHFamxS7fGdaKwKKgMzq"], "tags": ["SpaceFarmer", "BRAZE", "Collection", "SpaceStuff"], "extra": {}}
