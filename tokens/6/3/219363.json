NFTipi and three red triangles came into my mind. i quickly got up and turned my computer on to do a domain search. it was mine. i registered and set a quick website and made my clubhouse profile NFTIPI. the three triangles are my tipi representations of community. it is a global community as you all are each one tipi and collectively we are more. i chose the color red as in my mother(Medewiin Elder) shared teaching that our ancestors can see the color red. this is why we offer tobacco in red cloth-for them to see us and for us to connect with them.\n\nthe very first words i put onto my clubhouse, twitter profile and graphic i ever made with one of my tipi renditions in March 2020 is  \u146d\u14c7\u14c8\u1422\u146f\u14a5\u144e\u1423 kinan\u00e2skomitin (thank you I am grateful to you). it is a community piece that many have been asking for from me. So here it is to acknowledge my 6 months here and the first Direction of EAST/SPRING Medicine Wheel on Foundation. i am finally put this work out here on HEN with another NFTIPI in space community version on Eth blockchain. this is priced as equivalent as those pieces.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdEcqKchLpfKUh5HLrCEUB5zN47UBwoPJvEYECAnhAKoC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXBFm6944YZQuBe5BZZrLhc3HBSAnNNE9qCzPbUqEQeL1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdEcqKchLpfKUh5HLrCEUB5zN47UBwoPJvEYECAnhAKoC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MuKUhS9iP9jWxkxPb9dmgLuMr6sG981Q3"], "tags": ["#Photography", "#DigitalArts", "#Indigenous", "#Cree"], "extra": {}}
