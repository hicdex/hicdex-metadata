By using \"Me\" as the subject of my art, I can get as bawdy or naughty, playful or silly as I desire. My art uses savage color in serene moments. I hope you like my exploration and play. I've created these CryptoGurls to humor, inspire, and turn you on... to the Metaverse. I'd be honored to be in your collection. xoRobbi\n\n\nRelationships are volatile, like #Crypto. We savor 1st Loves (like BTC), then hop in bed with a sexier 2nd (ETH).\u00a0HODL our favorite lover...we can be irresponsibly long.\u00a0We Roll-Up & Shard.  Trade 'up' for a quickie short? A longer, sexier hold? Play with the  ALT lifestyle? We ALL yearn for a frothy ride...a fast rise.\u00a0\u00a0Yet, OG's KNOW that Pump and Dump is NOT a long-term-win strategy.For your heart, or for Defi. Yes, #CryptoGurls like Moons and Lambos. But Quality is Curious. & Smart.\u00a0We delight in Volatility. We stay in...unlike lesser mortals. Fear jacks us up & makes us lean. Crypto-Gurls may be Unicorns, but good investments are Buy & HODL.\u00a0They're worth it; because a great #CryptoBabe will Forever UP your Gain.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd83NSNm15NokfuRGfPhNTRZNpzuhEGTZHpy94c9gYP4Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbAiJkf5GuLdhtLyxAPokPbx411jVrZNNKuqsFXAThGJj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd83NSNm15NokfuRGfPhNTRZNpzuhEGTZHpy94c9gYP4Z", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NBB5xRmR9LSMwZBvfKbokkU8Br4tDnSGt"], "tags": ["portrait", "figure", "figureative", "cryptoportrait", "selfportrait", "femaleartist", "famousfemaleartist", "femaleart", "womanartist", "sexyart", "nude", "nudeart", "sexyfemale", "lesbianart", "lesbiannonbianary", "sexyartist", "professionalartist", "colorful", "neonnoir", "noir", "art", "photography", "figureativephotography", "avatar", "defi"], "extra": {}}
