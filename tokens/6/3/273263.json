Nonetheless, as specimens now with new user names, they are captured again.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeieeyea7kuj6ulrwznsqg5bjkmurqjejopxp533vu46bbclf6h6cam", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicwb7hhhpmt4gf7ncyr7ke75xj4ru3lipk7isdadw7rag4ribsxna", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeieeyea7kuj6ulrwznsqg5bjkmurqjejopxp533vu46bbclf6h6cam", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XR6K5u8atyJGJjm6EawvnwGq7odbMKmzQ"], "tags": ["gan", "generativeart", "ganart", "generative", "past", "present", "future", "machinelearning", "neuralnetwork", "contemporaryart", "digitalart", "modernart", "surrealism", "surreal", "aiart", "jettroxx", "memory", "untitledmemories", "popart", "photomanipulation"], "extra": {}}
