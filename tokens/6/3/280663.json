We will try to avoid them, kill them, but like in a vision we become entangled with them. They don\u00b4t disappear.\n\nWe are what we have done, do and will do; all at the same qualitative time.

Negates the facts, and therefore, what we are. The first person to be lied to is oneself, the worst lie we can resort is to forget ourselves.\n\nSingularity as a detained space.
