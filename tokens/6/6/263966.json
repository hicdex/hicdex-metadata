{"__version": 1, "token_id": 263966, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - Strong Grid Dissolved 02", "description": "Unfolding of a lattice obtained through graph algebra operations (strong product) from basic primitives (path graphs) with random node removal. Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras.\n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 400 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidh7j3vgdhoxrhvfozqfdqukdbnajxnf6ftvv46jen5drfgkfbvrm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicryddekr6l5vasybeapwgfiimrn5w6at5pcv6yf3org6whqxc2oe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidh7j3vgdhoxrhvfozqfdqukdbnajxnf6ftvv46jen5drfgkfbvrm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra"], "extra": {}}
