I actually think we have a huge opportunity to do that because as G7 we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world, a solution to the problems of climate change, and in those ideas and technologies which we\u2019re all addressing together, I think there is the potential to generate many millions of high-wage, high-skilled jobs. I think that\u2019s what people of our countries now want us to focus on. They want us to be sure we\u2019re beating the pandemic together and discussing how we\u2019ll never have a repeat of what we\u2019ve seen, but also that we\u2019re building back better together. Building back greener, and building back fairer, and building back more equal and, how shall I\u2026 in a more gender-neutral and perhaps more feminine way. How about that? Apart from anything else.\u2019\n\n- Boris Johnson, addressing world leaders at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England 2021\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmerxdsHKDEYtfYJfG2Ym8rvY5HcTcWr4PB2ba8SVs7p7X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWAoYNFK4WVernhGidK28pkGpo7ekcYzLEfMQXNonuo9u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmerxdsHKDEYtfYJfG2Ym8rvY5HcTcWr4PB2ba8SVs7p7X", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LXrEkphyTS9GzM74ofNrYVZ8xZKmbtX4m"], "tags": ["ai", "generative", "celebrity", "portrait", "surreal", "feminine", "gender", "fluid", "dadaism", "boris", "buildbackbetter"], "extra": {}}
