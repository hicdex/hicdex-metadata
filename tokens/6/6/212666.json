It is the life, in her expansion from the microcosm to the macrocosm, which, like its own immaterial origins, leads us to inform matter. Humanity is invested by the life of a cosmic quest towards the stars and the artificial creatures are the tools that will allow us to ensure her expansion in the universe. Augmented Artwork.
