{"__version": 1, "token_id": 265766, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The hanged man", "description": "The hanged man understands that he had to make a sacrifice in order to move forward - whether it was as a repentance for past wrongdoings or as a calculated step backward to recalculate his path forward. This time he spends here will not be wasted; it is a necessary step in his development. His inverted state can also represent the feelings of those who follow a spiritual path, as they see the world in a different light. You see things differently than others who don't understand the need to sacrifice. As you walk the path alone, this is a natural course of action for you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiem2dcfq3a7nrhtwvugb3lnvoxdkvo4cocuaogtpdc6vgfyeqzabi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicjhxeqh4bqfytxrslvjcxbgpi4ym7giqo23uks2n4zpgh5jll2hi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiem2dcfq3a7nrhtwvugb3lnvoxdkvo4cocuaogtpdc6vgfyeqzabi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1enACDiHTRGsVwS9XxrXuiz84ZABdTtdkm"], "tags": ["AI", "Tarot"], "extra": {}}
