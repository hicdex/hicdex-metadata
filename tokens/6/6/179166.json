Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islamism, and other religions have touched this knowledge somehow, and the concept of Sacred Geometry is present across many ancient cultures.\n\nI dare to bring such invisible realms into existence through a real image, here available as my genesis NFT. \n\nSacred Geometry #1 (edition of 2), is part of the project Impermanent Sculptures, started in 2015 and is still ongoing. It is the result of laser cut stencils palette, fire sparkles and light painting photography done onsight with later adjustments on Photoshop.\n.\n.\n.\nVitor Schietti\u2019s work is dedicated to the visual representations of dreams and memories as building blocks of one\u2019s identity. His motifs go from landscape to portrait, often applying long exposure and light-painting techniques.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbFwQ6ypJLGn3D34wCaqfsAAdZE2b3v6NBdU4RbXKDiS2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWUFxEG3VvSMbbQ11QxZ4X6VzN3dNVtbuLqq4mXzcuTVt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbFwQ6ypJLGn3D34wCaqfsAAdZE2b3v6NBdU4RbXKDiS2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Uki7n3eDNwTKeNXBhUMEZesDQksKNnEa3"], "tags": ["sacredgeometry", "geometriasagrada", "lightpainting", "vitorschietti", "performance", "portal", "dimension", "meditation", "imagination", "sparkles", "fireworks"], "extra": {}}
