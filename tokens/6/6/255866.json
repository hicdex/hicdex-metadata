This song is a tribute to the city of Bueno Brand\u00e3o since it is a mix of the local soundscape with a monotonic meditational sound.\n\nThe process of creation and production was minimalist done, only with a laptop, a headset and a lot of research on musical theory. Inspired by the DIY culture, \"Furniture Songs\" shows that virtually anyone can create their sounds without the need for expensive and specific equipment and hard work.\n\nTrack: 6 of 6\nGenres: relaxing, meditation, Lo-Fi\nMaster: Rodrigo Paschoal\nRelease Date: Apr 30, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbKKxAiQaDh4NexC4bSs1fLLpoXzruyqm2QJcNTavkimN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVWZkhiJYivhuqynoGEix3Cc48H6FLvpy7mL4NTfEZdb6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbKKxAiQaDh4NexC4bSs1fLLpoXzruyqm2QJcNTavkimN", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MM2wfCrRzGvXYTt1BsChqsACaF5SJQiVN"], "tags": ["music", "lofi", "chill-out", "relaxing", "meditation", "Lo-Fi"], "extra": {}}
