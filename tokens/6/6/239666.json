I could pick up the book, read my favorite part, watch the movies over and over and peruse the internet for hours trying to learn new things about middle earth. this song had the essence of treebeard to me. \n\nthe cover art was generated by AI using the text prompt \"treebeard\" and it delivered on what it thought treebeard would look like. can't say it was too far off! \n\nBop your head and enjoy the music. If you purchase this piece, hit me up on twitter @ryanartwalker and I will send you the album with high quality WAV files! \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPrBYgrxfnxMsJYJcxBHFskJPRj6bS9hX99v8JnnBYcDc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRdSgArX9vTNAnhj5cc1pwb1JvcuhHrSc3ZG4CiQFTPDL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPrBYgrxfnxMsJYJcxBHFskJPRj6bS9hX99v8JnnBYcDc", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bDv64M6g5HV1CApCCXthpz69XxHvbgbn7"], "tags": ["souls", "beattape", "lofihiphop", "lofibeats", "arthur"], "extra": {}}
