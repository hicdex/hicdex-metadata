This is the reason why I like the idea of mooi indie, \"painting as entertainment,\" where in this current era is entertainment for our souls as human beings who are increasingly being eroded by busyness and ambition.\nThe more the times are growing, the more social distortions that occur between technology and society.\nThe desired natural landscape is increasingly hard to find because\neroded by new things and technology, so this triggers me to look for the longing of nature through the internet channeled through a screen.\nThis makes new thing to enjoying a landscape that we can call an unreal landscape. \nNatural emotion is a project to interpret the feelings I try to route with an image of panorama, where all the deepest feelings are hard to express our condition.\nIt's a form of emotional overflow, which cannot be captured by consciousness. Each individual has deep feelings about their feelings.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbYjhobak4CUjBWbAewTbroGKhW9txFMTFM3N5c33qhBr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVuB6iXehVNdNMnmohtmwRWHiVuMFPr1MKhhFdZxMaqir", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbYjhobak4CUjBWbAewTbroGKhW9txFMTFM3N5c33qhBr", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YeDG2B2JmLLojfo6o3s4e4JwwHS5nfUvT"], "tags": ["Naturalemotion", "Mooiindie", "Indonesia", "Illustration", "Motion", "Art"], "extra": {}}
