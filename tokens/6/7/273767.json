No bed bugs. Totally clean. Just didn't need it after moving and no donation sites accept mattresses.\nI covered it in two plastic mattress bags and taped it, so it should still be clean despite being dragged into an alley. Located near apartment at 1440 N Ashland. Behind building in alley.\nIf you are interested in the bedframe for it, shoot me a message. I have all the parts and pieces packaged together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibdzi5464x4vosmitejb4r2c2xptlt7soq77apjp7oyq7u3r3aata", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibdzi5464x4vosmitejb4r2c2xptlt7soq77apjp7oyq7u3r3aata", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreibdzi5464x4vosmitejb4r2c2xptlt7soq77apjp7oyq7u3r3aata", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1efdGLEg5QWhi6cwAMYGZZE2Vp9s89QSJs"], "tags": ["trash", "photography", "craigslist", "wickerpark", "mattress"], "extra": {}}
