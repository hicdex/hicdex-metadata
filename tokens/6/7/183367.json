That piece proudly belongs to someone else now, and I'd eventually painted a third for myself, but neither captured what I'd stumbled onto with this, unfortunately damaged wood painting.\n\nWhen I painted the elk I became bored and frustrated with the results and started to carelessly mix my palette, and began 'vandalising' the failed sketch. Instead, bits of white, crimson and stray blue set the elk's antlers ablaze. A few more wild splotches with the mutant palette left me with a somewhat biblical looking scene. I've become very fond of it, but hadn't identified what made it unique until long after I finished the two larger pieces.\n\nAcrylic on wood\n\n971x1440\n\n@microwave_cooks", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaoPNZTqu8ExXW3wscZWiPydYfk28XBDeFYwNYh5A8x2D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT4EWfGdhwa9qscFPp5yZWqvLAfJbxf6E7U63LsHAmJyV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaoPNZTqu8ExXW3wscZWiPydYfk28XBDeFYwNYh5A8x2D", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Td8xyvPN6FoE18RUoEFbVyJugkrbYgky6"], "tags": ["liberation", "transformation", "ascension", "elk", "microwave"], "extra": {}}
