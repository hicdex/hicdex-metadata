Muscarine (in very small quantities) has been found in this mushroom, but experts consider it unlikely that the concentration is sufficient to account for the reported toxicity. Other poisonous compounds have recently been isolated from fruitbodies of Suillellus satanas, and so it is - Classed as a seriously poisonous species.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZd7vuET1EXDUAPXaDXzso5JztHgEQuEobBr4a1D9HKDn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZd7vuET1EXDUAPXaDXzso5JztHgEQuEobBr4a1D9HKDn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZd7vuET1EXDUAPXaDXzso5JztHgEQuEobBr4a1D9HKDn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushrooms", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
