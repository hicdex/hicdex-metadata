I've been making art for 16 years. I have been a live painter for 6 years and this is my first year doing digital art. Art has saved my life. I was raised by a single mother who trusted me to follow my own path. I wouldn't be able to work continuously to create a better life for myself if it weren't for her. The show is scheduled to take place on my birfday, August 7, in my birth city of Los Angeles at Innerspace gallery.\n31 of these will me made, 15 will be given away at the event, 15 will be available here. That's it. It's my 1st ever solo art show and I will be showcasing most of my physical art that has never been seen, if not all.
