The same disease is thought to have hit again. Several outbreaks of this disease were eradicated in Europe in the early 19th century, but it continues in other parts of the world (Central and Oriental Africa, Madagascar, Asia, parts of South America).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidrwh57msbimsntiscrzvm5k3p46vxkev7mwv56m6gswqfrz6zo7e", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiflhy7y7fmng4jmhz5gypqkctrr4y6tslzo76s4izx642m7znjn2i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidrwh57msbimsntiscrzvm5k3p46vxkev7mwv56m6gswqfrz6zo7e", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NzcW4KvVD6C4RVujT6RouZyLcAFyXLpHP"], "tags": ["illustrasion", "digitalart", "history", "virus", "art", "blackdeath"], "extra": {}}
