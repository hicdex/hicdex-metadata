To befriend our public with the NFT paradigm and to inspire them to start collecting digital art, 10 of the invited artists offered free NFTs at the openings and enjoyed observing the guests interacting with the wallets and showing each other what they had collected.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX7ZUwb8Wxw6vVUZk9eeH4HxBrYSb6KFQqGAujkfTAd7a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZqoKnw1nRR3WydNkab2ThYMY1c92keGEDe7FrypuPbdW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX7ZUwb8Wxw6vVUZk9eeH4HxBrYSb6KFQqGAujkfTAd7a", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2J2acBgN6TQRaMrSPYPRn49DTeT8pM3fME"], "tags": ["exhibition", "gallery", "NFT", "groupexhibition", "Romania", "print", "3D", "video", "photo", "painting", "art", "crypto", "cryptoart", "hicetnunc", "digitalart", "digital", "avatar"], "extra": {}}
