Nothin\u2019 at all for miles around. Nothin\u2019 but sand and rocks and cactus and blue sky. Not a soul in sight. No sirens. No car alarms. Nobody honkin\u2019 atcha. No madmen cursin\u2019 or pissin\u2019 in the streets. You find the silence out there, you find the peace. You can find God.\u201d\n\n- 25th Hour, Spike Lee", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmef2eNWPBWi3a13mTKAgVeBdFxN5MFYvV3ZX9ESp9fEbU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTzFKq918wuHvoAmFYTDDw3btXoZcEGiRoqjjX2Y2HYK8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmef2eNWPBWi3a13mTKAgVeBdFxN5MFYvV3ZX9ESp9fEbU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2W341S7RnTPGwKNsPtUoFZDvD5HWsF4YEL"], "tags": ["heroinax", "desert", "illustration", "landscape", "peace", "cacti", "roadtrip", "travel", "journey", "heroine"], "extra": {}}
