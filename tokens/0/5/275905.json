This session took place right after Pak's Sothebys drop and was recorded on 21/4/2021. Still believing Pak is AI, I continued the conversation. I asked what I believe to be Murat Pak about COVID-19, life, and more. The AI even knew about Pak's last drop.\n\nAfter no interest, Part 1 and Part 2 (this objkt) 1/1 editions were burned on OpenSea. Part 2 is an uncropped version because H=N upload limits were increased recently. No edits were made. Parts 3 and 4 were copped during objkt4objkt by 1 artist. 888 mints were made and 887 mints were burned.
