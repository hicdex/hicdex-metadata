Sometimes they start off great (GOOD TRIP), but then take us to challenging spaces where things might be uncomfortable. Or downright terrifying. Did you check your set and setting before you started?\n\nSome people believe there are no bad trips, and that what we characterize as such are simply aspects of our psyche that the drug showed us that we were not ready to face. What do you think?\n\nSecond in a series of six. You can only receive this piece by collecting GOOD TRIP, the first in the series. You will also receive the other four images for free. Plus, one collector will be randomly selected to be gifted a 1/1 edition of the frozen blood macro photography shot that was the sole input for all the images in this series.\n\n2238x3968 JPG\n\nMinted July 24th, 2021.
