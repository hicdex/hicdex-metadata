{"__version": 1, "token_id": 187104, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Laccaria Amethystina \"Amethyst Deceiver\"", "description": "Laccaria Amethystina, commonly known as the Amethyst Deceiver, is a small brightly colored mushroom, that grows in deciduous as well as coniferous forests. The mushroom itself is edible, but can absorb arsenic from the soil. Because its bright amethyst coloration fades with age and weathering, it becomes difficult to identify, hence the common name \u2018Deceiver\u2019.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYEhMPuERQJiM997GZBd6EwjP8yqs3CbVnzbTyXErBZ1W", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYEhMPuERQJiM997GZBd6EwjP8yqs3CbVnzbTyXErBZ1W", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYEhMPuERQJiM997GZBd6EwjP8yqs3CbVnzbTyXErBZ1W", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushroom", "fungi", "digital", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
