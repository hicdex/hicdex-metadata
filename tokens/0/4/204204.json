When she was in her teens, surfing was considered a male sport. At 16 she knew she wanted to devote her life to professional surfing and entered professional events all around Australia. Cutting a long story short, she went on to become the only surfer, male or female, to claim six consecutive world titles (1998 to 2003). She is now widely regarded as the most successful female surfer in history and an iconic woman in sport.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUH2B4xezCqWtgzDX4G7Fx7koktrwDfHm8wLjXUMziZZ6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRMcA6Kry9bQ6t51QkmxEksd9qLnzj9Fc2hvKNfj7yozu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUH2B4xezCqWtgzDX4G7Fx7koktrwDfHm8wLjXUMziZZ6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "surfing", "surf", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
