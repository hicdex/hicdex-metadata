The full drawing depicts three turkeys, running on a red road. It's based on a scene in my upcoming book: Hypersensitivosaurus and Cold Turkey, where these big running birds are training to survive. \n\nThe birds ended up not looking very much like turkeys but I couldnt' help but love this road runner close up and decided to put it up here. It's moving so fast that it's impossible to get it in focus.
