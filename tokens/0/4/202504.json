As all of my upcoming projects my artworks always have some relationship with wine or food (I am a Sommelier and Foodie by heart. \n\nIn this case I thought about one of my favourite artists Roy Lichtenstein and one of my favourite grape varietals. As an result of that thought so called Roy Riesling was born. You can enjoy the artwork with a fresh, crisp Riesling. \n\nCheers!
