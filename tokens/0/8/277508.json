The Lyttelton Port of Christchurch owns the land behind the station building, access to which is restricted to authorised personnel. The original Lyttelton station signal box also survives, and is now sited near the station building. It was originally located at the western end of the yard near the tunnel portal. All railway-related facilities on wharf no. 2 have been removed, including the railway/ferry inter-modal facilities.
