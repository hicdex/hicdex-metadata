{"__version": 1, "token_id": 191508, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Kiss", "description": "I paint seascapes that evoke human emotions. Just as in this Poem by Rabindranath Tagore [1861-1941] who is considered the greatest writer in modern Indian literature. The kiss in the clouds is used as a metaphor for the search for love. After a love lost a new love is found, deeper for the storms the heart has been through in the past. This is a complicated love after decades of a life fully lived.\n\n\n\n\"The Kiss\" ~ by Rabindranath Tagore\n\nLips' language to lips' ears.\nTwo drinking each other's heart, it seems.\nTwo roving loves who have left home,\npilgrims to the confluence of lips.\nTwo waves rise by the law of love\nto break and die on two sets of lips.\nTwo wild desires craving each other\nmeet at last at the body's limits.\nLove's writing a song in dainty letters,\nlayers of kiss-calligraphy on lips.\nPlucking flowers from two sets of lips\nperhaps to thread them into a chain later.\nThis sweet union of lips\nis the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVbCRg5pg5XYiTrEToYFxoBLvxKDRxcqcpCFo9E7MDQJP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVtqRhEuDjKtWv9ayyPZFsSpbxzFDMfB8XHYwAm3KpqPZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmVbCRg5pg5XYiTrEToYFxoBLvxKDRxcqcpCFo9E7MDQJP"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["TheKiss", "Watercolor", "watercolour", "painting", "abstract", "clouds", "StephanieFuller"], "extra": {}}
