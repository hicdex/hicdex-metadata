I wanted to pair that consistency with my artistic practice.\n\nA new \"pan\" is usually baked on Thursday evenings. New drawing to follow soon after. \n\nPrevious drawings can be found on Foundation & Rarible. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmasrmsfbWSxFYoMiTzPXforLKUnys3EdYegcL2iruJRwg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmasrmsfbWSxFYoMiTzPXforLKUnys3EdYegcL2iruJRwg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmasrmsfbWSxFYoMiTzPXforLKUnys3EdYegcL2iruJRwg", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VwAPwtHtQ2jADWSzBJ8kBQQMV2NtcU4W8"], "tags": ["Ojeda", "Bread", "Drawing", "sourdough", "animation"], "extra": {}}
