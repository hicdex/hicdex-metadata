The linear sense is displaced by a multilateral and deep sense. The interaction of worlds as different as the real and the imaginary are the proposal to triumph over the spectators. My main idea is to create a fusion between art and everyday reality. Losing the logical-temporal instinct and reaching a state beyond the passage of time, at a point where everything and everyone disappears; the inner state of absolute wisdom. When we stop walking a path through life, love and time, to become life, time and eternal love. The Universe is not a place at a fixed point, but is everywhere from the micro to the macrocosm. The various dimensions, thanks to artistic reality, come to life and make it easy for us to transport ourselves to worlds never before imagined.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNZdsNqBhiigjDKHAVc5XmoLWjH986gFL2kJoo6289p5V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfNkLkZNuCHTBAKYDhVz2EZPTmbkEHMiemyTKLSwkF781", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNZdsNqBhiigjDKHAVc5XmoLWjH986gFL2kJoo6289p5V", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bDu8T9WigjAvU9vTu1t7UmRYtf5UaW8gi"], "tags": ["", "art", "universe", "love", "animation", "gif", "stopmotion", "digitalart", "videoart", "digitalartist", "woman", "3D", "3DMax", "daiana_lazzarin", ""], "extra": {}}
