The unlimited potential of outcomes in fractal Art is truly astounding.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTwLqhMhtFRxsxh5A8r2VNLt9RCsCtVwk5M25Kq84K2kh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTYHngnAP72ZTVgbHZWz7hj4479qMBhKeRjveSmty2ejN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTwLqhMhtFRxsxh5A8r2VNLt9RCsCtVwk5M25Kq84K2kh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1acsjcCfbZYeWzkR53xG9otkFRrbHAfAQ9"], "tags": ["fractal", "abstract", "art", "waves", "contained", "fractalart", "blue"], "extra": {}}
