{"__version": 1, "token_id": 193107, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Metamorphosis", "description": "Handmade collage using local, recycled magazine paper. \n\n'Metamorphosis' is the first of KCCatherine's 'Universal Human' series.\n\nThis piece was inspired by a tarot reading \nI did for myself, having pulled the Death and Judgement cards. These cards read together offer a message of embracing the good that can come from change. \n\nThe piece is very symbol-heavy. In the background, the sunrise represents the hope of new beginnings. The vagina to represent birth. Skulls for death and snakes for transformation through death. Flowers growing from death and decay, using it as a fuel. The double eye represents seeing with both the human mind and divine mind simultaneously. While difficult to maintain constantly, this balance is important to have.\n\nMy intention with this piece is to remind viewers that we have more control over our lives than we often think. We can control the chapters of our lives- when they begin, when they end, and what's in them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT8vtkfJp86eiduBPJQCnonHe4SQqjeNttFu2RGa1DXBP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeF3PKjtRSiwJgoQJb4oFT5iCwYews6UggTLK7s9QnyK3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT8vtkfJp86eiduBPJQCnonHe4SQqjeNttFu2RGa1DXBP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XLUjvJKXHmp2djPmFe8MkrSoJx8sDL6U3"], "tags": ["collage", "handmade", "spiritual", "trippy", "physical", "symbolism", "upcycled", "recycled", "recycledart", "spiritualart", "spirituality", ""], "extra": {}}
