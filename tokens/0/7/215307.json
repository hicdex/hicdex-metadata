Like in all other scenes of my country, you can see they are standing in the shadow. While children and men embrace themselves, they are worrying about food and supplies. Mothers they are, mothers they will be.\nWomen cook the food for the whole village during ten first days of Muharram, the votive food is called Nazri, formerly it was meant to be for the poor. But nowadays, people cook food in the village for their family and everyone they know, and everyone values the food made for Muharram. \nhttp://danub.de/news.cfm?id=286\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYKrEnak38MS7DBWLHReXcNUeMsTwWTQFuXhXL64GgLEW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbEJnev2RCQ5e7VGyVerEdtttwYVSA8Ux7ZawPf4jt9ZU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYKrEnak38MS7DBWLHReXcNUeMsTwWTQFuXhXL64GgLEW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "People", "Photo", "Human", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "35mm", "BW", "ritual", "streetphotography"], "extra": {}}
