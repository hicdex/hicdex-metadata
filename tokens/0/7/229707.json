I crave dynamic texture in my work and seek new ways of discovering fresh textures every day. I frequently subject my paintings to various forms of digital manipulation throughout my creation process, always chasing that next new \"feeling\". This time I decided to train a model using only physical paintings as inputs and see what the AI spits out. It did not disappoint.\n\nImage #10 of a 11-still set; Series #1 of the AI: Acrylic Intelligence collection.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZpNyN3GJRjY3YMuDUQ8we2hBFc5nwBNDYEKCkpyuixcu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZkyzXWJAYaHUJjcVUsTHXXeNcYFMjuRXZhPB7xbvRa5y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZpNyN3GJRjY3YMuDUQ8we2hBFc5nwBNDYEKCkpyuixcu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eK6niFEPoaa3EfBfzLLXV2A6KVBma3YNs"], "tags": ["painting", "abstract", "ai", "generative", "artificialintelligence", "perfesser", "acrylic", "playform", "aiart", "gan"], "extra": {}}
