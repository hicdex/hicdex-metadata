He is missing 4 fingers, averages 270 a game, hates wearing underwear, doesn\u2019t believe in socks and invented the 7-10 banana split sundae that he likes to serve to guests during birthday parties, while wearing a gorilla suit. After a long shift you can find him in the karaoke lounge belting out Karma Chameleon by Culture Club, a tribute to every red, gold, and green bowling ball he\u2019s ever had to retire.\n\nLimited collection of #100 unique AI born #WEIRDOS\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/weirdos\nThey're a little strange, but aren't we all?
