Minnie, 27, and 5 foot 2 inches tall was arrested in The United States on December 13, 1902 for larceny from a person (stealing). She listed her occupation as a prostitute and it was also noted that Minnie wore a wig. Police were renowned at the time to arrest people like Minnie with very little evidence and dishonest intent. Not much else is known about Minnie, but her attitude and resilience lives on in this work.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdexNjXYcFQqjrJEK8655SmkDoPkLoxZFb4ZHadNaNpzR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUx4NTEpcnN9tnkbBGviMkPvwuDJJh56eL4ywpR34ZXDh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdexNjXYcFQqjrJEK8655SmkDoPkLoxZFb4ZHadNaNpzR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
