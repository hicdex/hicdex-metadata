She is best remembered for organizing the UK suffragette movement and helping women win the right to vote. Time magazine named her as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating that \"she shaped an idea of women for our time\" and \"shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back\". She was widely criticised for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about their effectiveness, but her work is recognised as a crucial element in achieving women's suffrage in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u273aThis work is part of PixelFems, an evolving project on the Tezos blockchain celebrating iconic women from the past and present\u273a\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbNYhW7bnFDBMkarzkKS4kFj7gxmc5pj9iQTB4k2JzaFV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYFiMnbNCGLsxsCZqY1e1Khpqj9gzCg13HaZ6mNM3qsvL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbNYhW7bnFDBMkarzkKS4kFj7gxmc5pj9iQTB4k2JzaFV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CkkH6GcyftcbyAzh2pBgkuQdGsEuT66CR"], "tags": ["PixelFem", "PixelFems", "FeministArt", "Feminism", "PixelArt", "WomenofNFT", "FeministNFT", "Historical", "Colorful", "Pixelation", "CryptoFem", "Female", "Woman", "NFTProject", "FeministProject", "PixelFemales", "Color", "Historical", "History", "Gender"], "extra": {}}
