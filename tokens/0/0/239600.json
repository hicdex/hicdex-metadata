She is a quiet patient woman, with a very gentle voice. She said to me, all of a sudden, some days I come here and yell in this free air, no one can hear.\nI remember the moment, because to imagine my sweet grandmother having that emotional breakdown in the middle of desert, was so strange.\nI told her, what bothers you so much to do something like this.\nShe answered, sometimes I can't express myself when dealing with everyday matters, like your grandfather and people around. I have to remain calm, So I come hear to yell my heart out.\nWe all need to yell our heart out sometimes.\n-\nDouble exposure 120mm photography", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNYYeo49ZYeiyQ999bDjUWCL31bR56ha4vtKqKG4rvSxb", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd86sqYu2CWzMUYV45hPf4TqisucfziKgo4ubDgqussce", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNYYeo49ZYeiyQ999bDjUWCL31bR56ha4vtKqKG4rvSxb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "Photo", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "120mm", "BW", "nature", "Doubleexposure"], "extra": {}}
