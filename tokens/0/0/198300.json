Every Cousins Prototype purchase funds developing and sharing new procedural illustrations, techniques and tools. \n\nCousins is the first procedural character project on Tezos or Ethereum (that I know of) to use a branching shape grammar to produce unique and varied illustrations. I predict we're going to see a lot more of this technique in the future.\n\nPlease join me in supporting the development of procedural artwork.
