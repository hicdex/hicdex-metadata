{"__version": 1, "token_id": 196700, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "\"Resonance Spike\"", "description": "The Schumann Resonance is a frequency measured in realtime that is emitting from the Earth. It is believed to be her heartbeat, her primal emanation as a living breathing being. It is literal vibration to us.\nAt peace, the Schumann Resonance is at 7.83 Hz. As you can see from the artwork, there are times when it gets as high as 170 Hz. I depicted it as \"BPM\" because it should be perceived as her sign of life. I know personally that on the high resonance days, I am hanging onto the rug for dear life, just like the guy in the picture. Intense energy.\nWhat could we do as a collective consciousness sharing life with this creature to help her stay at peace? Is she in pain? Is she angry? Is she just becoming more powerful? Is she becoming weaker? What reality do you want to live in? Can we really think of a planet we live on as responsible for life as the Sun is?\nAnyone who receives this art piece, please integrate awareness of this great being, and tune into her emotional body and heal with her. Exchange breath, and practice Ba Duan Jin Qigong with her. Pachamama is everywhere, and is everything. Aho, Beautiful Spirit!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYP7ziMcbCuN7RLxXgAafmknCdZsg5T5tjLkJt3PHRCLh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYP7ziMcbCuN7RLxXgAafmknCdZsg5T5tjLkJt3PHRCLh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYP7ziMcbCuN7RLxXgAafmknCdZsg5T5tjLkJt3PHRCLh", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1fyzeSfRFPnps1BjUQ5AMWdtkoj362Uuk2"], "tags": ["gaia", "love", "peace", "meditate", "nature", "earth", "kali", "pachamama", "schumann", "resonance", "heartbeat", "5d", "consciousness", "psychedelics"], "extra": {}}
