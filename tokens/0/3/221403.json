The property of function-oriented image generation that was used relates to the fact that an image is initially not defined by pixels, each of which is assigned an RGB value, but by a formula that is applied to each pixel position of an image, and thus this position assigns an RGB value. It is based on color space transformations that record RGB values \u200b\u200bor position descriptions of pixels in an image and generate a new RGB value. In the variant used here, exactly two are used as arguments that deliver exactly one output. Eight such color space transformations are used, this number being variable. When generating a 2-dimensional image, the coordinates of a point are read in as input, which occupy two of the three registers. The third register is assigned a constant value. Color space transformations are applied sequentially to these register entries, and the content of one of the registers is interpreted as the R, G or B value of the corresponding coordinate point. This means that this procedure can be interpreted as asexual reproduction, since only the position of the pixel is taken into account for the generation of a pixel, but not the positions of pixels or color values \u200b\u200bof other pixels.
