It hasn't sold more than twice. I hope, not to serve the purpose of what we call \"green washing\". So unfortunately I cannot , according to the laws of the offer and demand, ask a high starting price for this at this moment in time. \n\nIt seems there is not a lot of commercial demand for these kind of purpose around on this planet, at this time. Unless you here we can prove otherwise? I will divide this TriRecyclotron\u1d40\u1d39 in many editions for it to spread as much as possible. And afterwards, let's work on raising the value we assign to the idea of a sustainable and clean future.\ncan we just, at least, not have our short term behavior patterns destroy everything???\n\nhttps://videohive.net/item/recycle-symbol-pack/24600992", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVbtP3PcyMrRsL4shoZCbjNP85ZQ8ip21t37NQEdSnAV6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVbtP3PcyMrRsL4shoZCbjNP85ZQ8ip21t37NQEdSnAV6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVbtP3PcyMrRsL4shoZCbjNP85ZQ8ip21t37NQEdSnAV6", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["recycle", "durable", "sustainable", "clean", "ecofriendly", "repurposing", "greenwashing", "seamless", "loop", "animation"], "extra": {}}
