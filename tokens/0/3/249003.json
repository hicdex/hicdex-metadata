The 1/1, in turn, puts a frame around its 1000/1000 companion. In this way, the two Recursive Twins get tightly intertwined, thus reducing the artificial scarcity of the 1/1 to absurdity as both pieces essentially swap their contents in an endless, recursive loop.\n\nHTML/JS \u00b7 Original artwork by Andreas Rau \u00b7 Oslo, 2021\n\nDisclaimer: This artwork is an experimental piece that relies on the Hicdex API to function as intended", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWX4W3L3ARvVTNpsLPsardazvFhJzPKd3iwBxWagXVUKP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQvheyLyiJ6oWRZ59RiENPZP8GYqMUo3HM8vgpTZQzzGR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmV8vBNC6qTyCpf6UmPPiQpehfU64u1yhhpFyvmJ2k54QQ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWX4W3L3ARvVTNpsLPsardazvFhJzPKd3iwBxWagXVUKP", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WA853u95ekYKYB3Cfsu6N9uD6y49afGAw"], "tags": ["andreasrau", "recursivetwins", "recursive", "generativeart", "generative", "genart", "experimental"], "extra": {}}
