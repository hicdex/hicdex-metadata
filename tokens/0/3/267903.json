Film is a connection to lived experiences that we can subjectively relate to in the pastoral nature of sky and mountains. Whereas it is in tension with the more clinical nature of data and our acknowledgement of place as a political entity.\n\nThe intrinsic, tangible quality of celluloid film and paper print play to our sentimental memory bias making it harder to distinguish between what is real or fake. We take on the role of predicting the extent of ambiguity. \n\nIn the 'Fields of View' series, the dataset is derived of digitally scanned 35mm film slides depicting landscapes captured on family holidays.\nFeatures of similarity to sky and mountain terrain have been transformed and manipulated to create these visual outcomes. By transforming and manipulating certain features in the model the work makes comparison to historic in-camera editing techniques of cameraless film making.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifhdr54end7ikahcc7xqonyak7a6l242oggb2p4bnjfww7egif4vi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibhlwy5gobsibybounsxwnasqscr3j74xsp6jtfqo7hnfs4ohwjdy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifhdr54end7ikahcc7xqonyak7a6l242oggb2p4bnjfww7egif4vi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2C5dq1MMGbJ4SjfcvMxEz3gQKL8Sd6MoqB"], "tags": ["MachineLearning", "NetworkBending", "Landscapes", "35mmfilm", "Risographprint"], "extra": {}}
