We smoked a lot of indigenous joints before he became the idealistic and radical person he is now. Lately, he just wants to know about work and money, and he tells me that joints get in the way of people's happiness. He has to be very much in his own dreams to believe such a thing. But whoever hears him talk these days can't imagine the rock and roll we got into when we were younger. This punk was arrested with me, with Liberty and with Redeemer, trying to paint a rainbow on the wall of China.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU63cP1pFEeHipHwLVLY9yTAyjDnMnMe6EAnanM6J3Lnh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU63cP1pFEeHipHwLVLY9yTAyjDnMnMe6EAnanM6J3Lnh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU63cP1pFEeHipHwLVLY9yTAyjDnMnMe6EAnanM6J3Lnh", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhZnNDbg5XyurR2rPB7eNwZuAf4Jow6XJ"], "tags": ["CryptoDealer", "DigitalArt", "Weed", "NFTStory", "Story", "Literature"], "extra": {}}
