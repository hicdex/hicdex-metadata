Please Stand By, The Earth Is Heating Up. A recent United Nations report found that nations, no matter what they do or how much they cut carbon emissions, cannot stop global warming over the next 30 years. Even if nations started cutting emissions today, total global warming is likely to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next 2 decades, melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, destroying costal cities, and creating more frequent extreme weather conditions. We are at a pivotal point where we as a global community must do everything in our power to fight this problem by striving for net zero global emissions, removing as much CO2 from the air as possible through new recent technologies and doing our best to work together and help one another in this worldwide goal.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXt67v3ECKt9JUuDFznQ5mpZYWMdhnt7YJ8k3xULekktx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPSyKQNtqT5WCmL5piwKtUng3qWoQAwT2RTj18YX2HtJ9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXt67v3ECKt9JUuDFznQ5mpZYWMdhnt7YJ8k3xULekktx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["COLORPALETTES", "COLORPALETTE", "TV", "DIGITALART", "GLITCHART", "DIGITALART", "COLOR", "colorpalettes", "colorpalette", "glitchart"], "extra": {}}
