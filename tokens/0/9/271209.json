Face with fleshy heart-shaped mouth with paint on the upper lip, small round nose, medium spaced eyes, eyebrows half filled with long hairs and with 5 small dots painted symmetrically on the forehead. Without showing the hair, covered by a dark scarf.\n\nMY STORY:\nI chose this name because I like to dress in different genders according to my mood and I can use it at all times. Most of the time I wear a hood or a headscarf. I started training so that people wouldn't notice me on the street but they say that my face is too striking. Now I study people's bodily behavior and I can flow through any of them with ease.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicgbtguhlsp45krjsjpz2npjfwldnutp7ifuo4ytwthxl7z3mmjyi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicgbtguhlsp45krjsjpz2npjfwldnutp7ifuo4ytwthxl7z3mmjyi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreicgbtguhlsp45krjsjpz2npjfwldnutp7ifuo4ytwthxl7z3mmjyi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1M3y4z9Z3oa5Cip2CCXt54BzN59GbnHqRt"], "tags": ["tnha", "diversity", "nftart", "digitalillustration", "blackandwhite", "mystory"], "extra": {}}
