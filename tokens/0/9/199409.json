When I was a child, I used to have night terrors. I would wake up in the middle of the night scared out of my wits. Sometimes I would hallucinate that the room was growing suddenly enormous, which would scare me even more. Then I had an idea. If I imagined myself as this little mouse, cozy and warm in her little mouse bed under a little quilt, sleeping in her little mouse room, I wasn't as scared. I imagined this scene many times to comfort myself.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRZugW9pwLjm7XW6XKoRvL9q3q46Ey6DHtJVpaKL3P375", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmedReDnZT9ugGkFinZjrkQ5JWm2MunHS9XdiQjyDBA6H2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRZugW9pwLjm7XW6XKoRvL9q3q46Ey6DHtJVpaKL3P375", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Vnh3wJnqKJstnnhWo8ZXUHrbE9nYRE42Y"], "tags": ["pandemic", "coronavirus", "La'Rona"], "extra": {}}
