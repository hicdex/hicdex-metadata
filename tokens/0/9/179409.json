You take a photo at 5:43 to capture that moment with the beautiful sky and traversing clouds.\n\nClouds, yes, clouds are there but also something else.\n\nYou realize there is a bright object. It is not the sun. It is not the moon. It is none of the stars. What is that? That is a question.\n\nArtistic value (if any) is in timing, in composition. \n\nNo photo manipulation beyond cropping, and adjusting the tone, color & contrast.\n\nIt is what it is. A question. \n\n740\u200a\u00d7\u200a1030px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmStQm5qV1eQwWFWrwb17sje953mVoCtbp1zgDF9LF8gRs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmStQm5qV1eQwWFWrwb17sje953mVoCtbp1zgDF9LF8gRs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmStQm5qV1eQwWFWrwb17sje953mVoCtbp1zgDF9LF8gRs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Si9QC2RuiyPamLRZRjp9YcXXYCuPDm5BC"], "tags": ["question", "sky", "clouds", "unidentfied", "alien", "space", "morning", "scifi"], "extra": {}}
