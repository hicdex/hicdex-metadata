Cheers!\n\n--\n\n\nOne day I met someone who made me wonder how good it is to be able to live closely to nature. I imagine waking up to a green scenery right outside my window, inhaling the real air that humans are supposed to breath in. \n\nOur modern way of living have set us apart from the nature and most of the time, we aren't aware of things that we do slowly destroy it. \n\nAnd it got me to a question; is there any chance that my future children be able to wake up to a green scenery right outside their windows, inhaling the real air that human are supposed to breath in?\n\n--\n\nHi everyone! This is the third part of a series called \u201cStories from 10 People I Once Knew\u201d. My writings in this series are responding to stories of 10 people that once have touched my heart and I\u2019d like to share them to 100 other people.\n\nHopefully you can feel the stories together with me and you can re-share them to anyone else that might need warm words. \n\nHugs,\nYY\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQvSxdAY3qVBxDLFwSTW4F6xpcHFbun8ToNAYFHzsiqLG", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma1ZXJ45riiUAkuu7LqMQaRsSyfoq3oiJKseRRiuSkUnp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQvSxdAY3qVBxDLFwSTW4F6xpcHFbun8ToNAYFHzsiqLG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XSa1ZQ8ECTUL7dwEZKbpqoCs52My3Mnhx"], "tags": ["writing", "songlyric", "song", "textbased", "indonesianwriter", "poetry"], "extra": {}}
