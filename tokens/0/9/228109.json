It had been another long day and the outdoors was doing me well. Suddenly I stopped, took a deep breath, and looked around. I get lost in my own head a lot thinking and because of that I miss a lot. I\u2019ve been trying to get better, but it\u2019s hard. When you\u2019re focused so laser sharp, and and pushing so hard to make something happen\u2026it\u2019s easy to forget. So this picture was my reminder. And a thank you to @captainstax for encouraging me to mint this. They reminded me to practice what I preach and mint what I make. :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaH7fyTTYusgdjXvvHgtTZv3CDhdyuat1kpBoyE6LPQut", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdi6JhN2vX2M19sxMmxe8P5LX6rwBEk1Jn7vqHBiBTr7X", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaH7fyTTYusgdjXvvHgtTZv3CDhdyuat1kpBoyE6LPQut", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2LjW2Zw6VY8G5aaH7JUBN4XdYSF3mKqGh8"], "tags": ["Weasel", "photography", "2021", "Losangeles", "sunset"], "extra": {}}
