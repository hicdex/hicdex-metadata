Each piece is unique 1/1 and contains a 15 second motion loop created in adobe after effects with original ambient composition that I created in Reason and a matching 2000 x 2000 JPG.\n\nDisambiguation refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear. The shape used in this piece is a typographic [bracket] character which does just that when placed in a sentence.
