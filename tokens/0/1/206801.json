This was a project in college for Humanities subject back in 2012. We were tasked to create an artwork in one day. No themes, no categories. Just any artwork that you can find. I forgot the exact reason why I created this but all I can remember is that in the current age right now, we don't have privacy anymore. Someone is always watching us. Somebody is always manipulating our next move. Some companies are selling our data and behavior. The worst part is, almost all of us are even not aware of it.
