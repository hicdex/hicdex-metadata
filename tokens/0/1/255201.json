It consists of 100 cast iron figures facing towards the sea. The figures are modelled on the artist's own naked body. The work proved controversial due to the naked statues but has increased tourism to the beach. After being exhibited at two other locations it was put on display at Crosby on 1 July 2005. After some controversy, Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council decided on 7 March 2007 that the sculptures should be permanently installed at the beach. \n\nDr. Mart\u00edn Raskovsky\nhttps://martinr.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWGRaaY7paabyMcxC12dRHuhmcwaVruHJtLukNCwwrCau", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmefNeNF4J7eqSwUcuwf65b8Ugf9vwGac4ujL2pzYM31px", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWGRaaY7paabyMcxC12dRHuhmcwaVruHJtLukNCwwrCau", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R7tXrF5LM783mQFmEPp3qg14ooqakCcJ8"], "tags": ["crosby", "reflection", "sculpture", "sand", "Gormley", "water", "sunset"], "extra": {}}
