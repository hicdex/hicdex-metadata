{"__version": 1, "token_id": 238201, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Collage #9 (Herman Webster Mudgett)", "description": "Herman Webster Mudgett, better known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes, was an American serial killer active from December 1891 to November 1894. Despite his confession of 27 murders (including some people who were verifiably still alive) while awaiting execution, Holmes was convicted and sentenced to death for only one murder, that of accomplice and business partner Benjamin Pitezel. Victims were killed in a mixed-use building which he owned in Chicago, located about three miles west of the 1893 World's Fair: Columbian Exposition, supposedly called the World's Fair Hotel (informally called \"The Murder Castle\"), though evidence suggests the hotel portion was never truly open for business.\n\nBesides being a serial killer, Holmes was also a con artist and a trigamist, the subject of more than 50 lawsuits in Chicago alone. Holmes was executed on May 7, 1896, nine days before his 35th birthday.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRPrYMb3JCkfqotr21QAPdGFMgUBQZ59APBmTeT5YHwGn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVLQF8FrhHKVkFGjnVcqpJLfgPBU4wN28Tt7oBH9a38B9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRPrYMb3JCkfqotr21QAPdGFMgUBQZ59APBmTeT5YHwGn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Collage", "theartofmann", "HHHolmes", "darkarts", "skull", "surreal", "suspense"], "extra": {}}
