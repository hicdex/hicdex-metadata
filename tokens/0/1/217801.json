Through ArtOwly, these artists have switched on to a new platform exploring the world of NFTs.\n\nTito Stanley\u2019s works capture and evoke the unknown. They explore pain and numbness simultaneously. The peculiar landscapes and his self-portraiture rule the surfaces and the minute details mesmerise the viewer. Troubled emotions are painted as lucid visuals in these works. While these works\u2019 emotional impact on the viewer cannot be neglected, his works contain much more. Biblical references, political views that voice discontent and a persistent sardonic gaze are a part of his visual vocabulary. The peculiar plants that appear in most of his works map out the artist\u2019s emotional journey, beginning with the leafless trees, vines and shrubs that swallow structures and buildings like carnivorous plants.  Paired with a vivid palette, the birds of prey, carnivorous plants, thorns, and figures entrapped in areas vacantly stare at us, creating an awe-inspiring effect.\n\nTito Stanley\u2019s artworks are autobiographical and allegorical. He is currently based in Baroda, pursuing his MVA in painting from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.\n\nOil on canvas / 91 x 91cm\n\nN.B. Shipping charges are extra.\n\nView our exhibition at: https://artowly.com/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmePGkZ843QQFEsabj6c2V7qhTjH7kZ7mvafR9mf6d8ztj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbNq2vicoWGTMJRjq8A4LUe5FTUBErWdwR1Y1rvmaHCg3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmePGkZ843QQFEsabj6c2V7qhTjH7kZ7mvafR9mf6d8ztj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2AfkJA16p4L1hmanKPv3eg6v7XepLknQJW"], "tags": ["Hoot_hoot", "Switch_on", "pain", "numbness", "death", "sardonic", "painting"], "extra": {}}
