If you purchase this piece, hit me up on twitter @ryanartwalker and I will send you the album with high quality AIFF files!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4zHwhQ5nMpKKhThKExNUkbLBiEPsgC9758R6LbBPkLC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRE7SdbhZwcK6WbDcAu2HPwt3YTXfoharBJViBv4H9cWG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf4zHwhQ5nMpKKhThKExNUkbLBiEPsgC9758R6LbBPkLC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bDv64M6g5HV1CApCCXthpz69XxHvbgbn7"], "tags": ["souls", "beattape", "lofihiphop", "lofibeats", "generativeart"], "extra": {}}
