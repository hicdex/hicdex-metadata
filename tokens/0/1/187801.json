It was just required to photograph it from every possible direction. After some editing, these characters just came to life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUFUJUwDKiAnbxYhNJJcHcsfaFn75uaoyVGGc4unoG1rX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcdS4Vnx1FdEd7Y1cZjn9Tce86bAexHVqXbezPiNJQYYR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUFUJUwDKiAnbxYhNJJcHcsfaFn75uaoyVGGc4unoG1rX", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZuXpzkdPKxGupK5CFM1zHPDtGh1PD9BKK"], "tags": ["Pillow", "Sofa", "Leather", "Digitalart", "Photography", "Fineart", "creachers", "madness", "Darkness"], "extra": {}}
