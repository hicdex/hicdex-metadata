{"__version": 1, "token_id": 178001, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Marie Curie", "description": "Marie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to ever win one in two different fields- both physics and chemistry! She coined the term radioactivity and discovered the elements polonium and radium. During World War One she developed mobile x-ray machines for use in field hospitals. Sadly all the exposure to radiation took it's toll and she died of aplastic anemia in 1934 aged 66.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZvFs7yLQYvdB6fLXYNnfL8TsQthVYi6WENoJNQYA1NT1", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd133UZDFLwzC15e21e9rcY4CJ1N7HmydmXCv7q6mEv9f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZvFs7yLQYvdB6fLXYNnfL8TsQthVYi6WENoJNQYA1NT1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bMY43V88srGDdWd3g879RQQTL8fqH56GD"], "tags": ["MarieCurie", "MadameCurie", "Radiation", "Polonium", "radium", "xray", "physics", "chemistry", "nobelprize", "science", "tardigrade", "tardigreat", "animated", "loop", "kawaii"], "extra": {}}
