Unlike the meditation series where I don't have a plan, for Breathe I wanted to keep the animation in time with breathing, so as to be helpful when anxiety attacks come.\n\nThe original gif is based on the deep breathing technique I learned which is a slow deep breath in for 5 counts, hold, slow breath out for 5 counts, pause, and repeat.\n\nThe collaboration series is my hope to bring different touches to my pixel mediations. The collaborations are with 4 different artists I admire whose styles differ from mine but complement it. The results may change the initial timings and mood of the gif.\n\n@annaxmalina is a photographer and animator whose collage and mixed media work is very special to me. Emotive and poetic, it will remind you of memories you've never had, forgotten diaries, and dreams of days past or yet to come. This is why I had to have her collaborate on the Breathe series.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcN3Ytn3GJJ28cgFostrSmy7c7BnpS51TRpsvhsvEaQLx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdwFntXwTpDC9yuB8EkyYB7WvfEdXmnj4o5QzyJ367WbG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcN3Ytn3GJJ28cgFostrSmy7c7BnpS51TRpsvhsvEaQLx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cALmpTf7EeeSBXHAX2rcnR4WAP8tSWkt6"], "tags": ["annaxmalina", "mumu_thestan", "breathe", "collage", "mixedmedia", "photography", "animation", "stopmotion", "painting", "monochrome", "pixelart", "collab", "collaboration", "eye", "mandala", "meditation"], "extra": {}}
