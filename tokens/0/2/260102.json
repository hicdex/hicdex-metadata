{"__version": 1, "token_id": 260102, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hermit the Crab", "description": "( most of ) my art is based on my life and ( how circumstances affect our ) thoughts and feelings. \n\nThis particular piece refers to my ( former ) hermit like life, in a mountain village in Portugal, further increased by the energy and effects of Covid19. \n\nIt also talks about introvertedness:\n\n\"Even though he loved to talk,\nHermit the crab was often alone. \nOn the top of the mountain, inside his shell.\"\n\n\nI created this work, 10 months ago. These days I am renting a house in another area, with more likeminded people around me. I am also in the process of selling my hermit house ( getting close ).  \n\nA little more info on this piece ( that I previously tried to sell on Hive's NFT Showroom ), can be found here:\n\nhttps://peakd.com/@vincentnijman/hermit-the-crab-whether-living-alone-is-loneliness-or-freedom-is-a-matter-of-perspective\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeies3qf2iu2f3a33wys37uekicqulvykn2y5bi53sricgysns7vn74", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreid66i26zd5fa5j5wduo7dro7ltjsx357wizgp7jsx37izctv5dtta", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeies3qf2iu2f3a33wys37uekicqulvykn2y5bi53sricgysns7vn74", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aa9PoZthm6yGFu8EPDaWDX3oc1XWu8oGq"], "tags": ["health", "mentalhealth", "depression", "introvert", "covid19", "hermit", "portugal", "painting"], "extra": {}}
