In the third dimension, three stages are taken into account: Past-Present-Future. Metaphysical science teaches us that these three stages are united, that they are one and the same stage. We, living on a planet where time is divided into parts, where space is the distance covered by days, hours, etc., believe that yesterday, today and tomorrow are separated. This science tells us that there is an eternal present and that when we manage to understand this, we can live more calmly, intensely, today.\n\nDambass 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeige2qdjj7v352xuwfcjrz3v4345tcj6z5v4d6bntgqhdey6ofcsom", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigoqcbi7iu3ibmqmndd7wtm2vsoy5ukms4teunog7pq2qrqitzclm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeige2qdjj7v352xuwfcjrz3v4345tcj6z5v4d6bntgqhdey6ofcsom", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VTDRb4f4ABmoeU7tEUj8SUvBauWvVsTos"], "tags": ["time", "present", "future", "past", "universe", "illustration", "art", "vector", "portals", "unity"], "extra": {}}
