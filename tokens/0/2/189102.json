They were not placed on this planet to be food for predators-men. They are part of the Tera-cell. They all serve a purpose and they are needed for the chain of evolution of the species.\nThey disincarnate and reincarnate. Sometimes they come back to their loved ones or they take another path depending on what they need for their evolution. Mistreating these innocent creatures turns into karma.\nIn the same way as the universe helps all of you evolve and elevate yourself above your current condition, so you should help these creatures evolve by facilitating their development.\"\n\nEl ser uno V \"los interanos - La ciudad de cristal\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQ7ZJKRk43NeDaEYQvh1FNrddLzZqiRWZ3sSa4MSg16V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTDb9XzbJ2MRFVGKrSkQzwx34tFTv3qxHNVwtjs7rX7fW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQ7ZJKRk43NeDaEYQvh1FNrddLzZqiRWZ3sSa4MSg16V", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Zz1bqTLAdP43E2roNHGRzyrxAkrvz2G2e"], "tags": ["animals", "cow", "3d", "matadero", "gjaq", "blue"], "extra": {}}
