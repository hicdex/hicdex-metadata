Women independency and their struggle in the modern era really inspires me.\n\nThis painting consists of two stylistic approaches: Abstract-action painting; and realism.\n\nThe abstract style is finished by marbling technique using high quality acrylic paint. I apply masking and action painting techniques that make the details of this abstract part spontaneous and precise. Blue, red, yellow, white and black are the primary colors, as symbols of the fundamentals of feminism: equality and struggle.\n\nThe realism style is finished using oil paints. The image of a flower-headed figure with clenched fists is a symbol of struggle. Cheetah, fighter jet, inline skate are symbols of acceleration and aggressiveness. Sunflowers are a symbol of beauty and hope.\n\nThe dualism of technique, color and composition is the strongest aspect of my work. The contrasting gray color with the dominant primary colors produces a harmonious composition between the background and foreground.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWoY4YeYGpu3wYCMyNokYMS3EPEYaqxAgtqLju5Qryz71", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRhyJPSwH8f9Udi8o25rWJxa5e3QDE4Z7pcbNWbK7fRqk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWoY4YeYGpu3wYCMyNokYMS3EPEYaqxAgtqLju5Qryz71", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eNFifnbBWyXSeB8w1E8ktijhce58JKRHP"], "tags": ["painting", "feminism", "animated", "cheetah", "jet", "skate", "flower", "emancipation", "fight", "love", "women", "equality", "freedom", "blue", "red", "yellow", "beauty", "hope", "marbling", "abstract", "realism", "gray", "contrast", "color"], "extra": {}}
