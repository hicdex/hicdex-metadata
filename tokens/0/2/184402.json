This sound piece consists from realtime work of group of oscillators tuned in harmonic way and running algorithmically according to the \"additive synthesis\" with \"random form\".  I use such a system to generate all my sound to all my audiovisual works. Recorded in realtime from the live algorithm. The composition seems to be a \"sustain\" sound for the ambient lovers and drone funs. Have a nice listening / using / mixing  process.  No sound effects are used. Pure wave physics.  Microsound. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaH8RqQ42r1WmGm5z3uSP2WgG8yDknH5ZDnWJLqKhRhCw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYYH1WvNwbUx7YtZTXMgJo1BEPrPXvz6sLESvGAL7Gqc8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaH8RqQ42r1WmGm5z3uSP2WgG8yDknH5ZDnWJLqKhRhCw", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1Mpr7WD3UG47UFPbizLPnBCNhh8pcdbSyz"], "tags": ["sound", "algorithm", "procedural", "custom", "coding", "algorithmic", "realtime", "harmonic", "sustain", "additive", "synthesis", "random", "form", "microsound", "pure", "wave", "oscillators", "harmonic", "ambient", "composition", "hi-res", "lossless", "44100", "16bit", "stereo"], "extra": {}}
