That piece proudly belongs to someone else now, and I'd even painted a third for myself, but neither captured what I'd stumbled onto with this, unfortunately damaged wood painting.\n\nWhen I painted the elk I became frustrated with the results and started to carelessly mix my palette, and began 'vandalising' the failed sketch. Instead, the bits of white, crimson and stray blue set the elk's antlers ablaze. A few more wild splotches of the mutant palette left me with a a somewhat biblical image I've become fond of, but I didn't identify what made it unique until long after I finished the two larger pieces.\n\nAcrylic on wood\n\n971x1440\n\n@microwave_cooks", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaoPNZTqu8ExXW3wscZWiPydYfk28XBDeFYwNYh5A8x2D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT4EWfGdhwa9qscFPp5yZWqvLAfJbxf6E7U63LsHAmJyV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaoPNZTqu8ExXW3wscZWiPydYfk28XBDeFYwNYh5A8x2D", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Td8xyvPN6FoE18RUoEFbVyJugkrbYgky6"], "tags": ["liberation", "transformation", "ascension", "elk", "microwave"], "extra": {}}
