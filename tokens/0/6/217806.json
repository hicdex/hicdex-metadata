Through ArtOwly, these artists have switched on to a new platform exploring the world of NFTs.\n\nShyam\u2019s artworks are the manifestations of his emotions. The distinctive visual language unique to him represents a multitude of intimate moments. His figures dominate the space and communicate through their bodies. Artworks born out of lines that flow and the primary colours seek to capture the oneness of love. Two figures merge in carnal love in these two works, becoming a single, inseparable form with a single eye. They blend into one in amorous passion as their worlds encounter one other and become whole.\n\nShyam Aramban is a freelance artist and illustrator. His creative art practice is a meditative process for him. He has completed his MFA in Painting from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.\n\nAcrylic and Charcoal on canvas / 2x2 feet\nN.B. Shipping charges are extra.\n\nView our exhibition at: https://artowly.com/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbtP7tBfX9ZWzZXcaEvQX9chSpTbZSbvC3iQvyPjhDNTa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS2HtS6RHcdUkqi6wGdnRVUgDup8UpWFzpHA4g6wZ87Nh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbtP7tBfX9ZWzZXcaEvQX9chSpTbZSbvC3iQvyPjhDNTa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2AfkJA16p4L1hmanKPv3eg6v7XepLknQJW"], "tags": ["Spirituality", "Hoot_hoot", "Switch_on", "Love", "Divine", "union", "Painting"], "extra": {}}
