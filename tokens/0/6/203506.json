The stumps resemble a monument, and are treated as such; they're being 'charged' with emblems and plaquettes related to The Plot's demise, and are encircled with a wood wall.\n\nThe top of one of the stumps is the face of ecological grief (top right). In the background: the letter 'P' in Ips typography (a font based on spruce bark beetle tunnel patterns). \n\nThe Plot is mapped, documented, used as a meeting point, and being prepared for regeneration.
