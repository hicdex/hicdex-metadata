{"description": "My work explores the relationship between emerging sexualities and copycat violence. With influences as diverse as Caravaggio and Roy Lichtenstein, new synergies are distilled from both explicit and implicit structures. Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the moment. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corrupted into a carnival of distress, leaving only a sense of unreality and the prospect of a new reality.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmZmx6RwVgJWHeYPGzquPHgj8yzgvuing7dCwyZ5Geqvhq"}
