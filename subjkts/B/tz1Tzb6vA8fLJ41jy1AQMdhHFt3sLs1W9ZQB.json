{"description": "About the Blackmass Design:   In the darkness that we do not perceive, what floats in the air and cannot be determined, the city and its noise, streets, lights, people, garbage, smog, all that becomes a dark amalgam. The design is a tool to channel it. The only way not to get contaminated with all that surrounds us is to spit it out and release it in this way.", "identicon": "ipfs://Qmb48cT3J8JQ9kWTXubAqgmVCy4TmGRicnqDdRyKeejLrD"}
