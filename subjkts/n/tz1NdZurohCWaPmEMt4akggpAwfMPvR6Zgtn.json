{"description": "Milton Sanz is a 3D artist born in 1993 in Rosario, Argentina. He worked for advertising agencies and for music industries worldwide.  However, he found his true passion becoming an artist and getting into  the world of CryptoArt.  His works capture dreams combining both expressionist and hyper-realistic aes\u0002thetics, materializing organic universes where the emotions of his characters seek  to cross the screen. Currently his art ventures into the trend of digital naturalism.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmcwFhQ4ybdc5MyusaRYjS2CJveNdg3bgb8E52ccyWW4kh"}
