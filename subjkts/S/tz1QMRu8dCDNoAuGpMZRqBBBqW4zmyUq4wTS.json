{"description": "Composition 2 is a series of 100 paintings produced sequentially, each one created on an identical matrix. The geometric composition is conceptually equivalent to the source code one might use in a computer program or web site. An identical visual framework is deployed to create many variations through simple modulations of hue and saturation. From a process of repetition and experimentation the phenomena of color is revealed to the viewer through many different outcomes.", "identicon": ""}
