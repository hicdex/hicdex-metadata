{"description": "I am a proud Houston native living and creating in Los Angeles where I have established myself as a program artist at Shockboxx Gallery and The LAAA (Gallery 825).  My techniques include charcoal, acrylic, spray paint, oil pastel, ink, resin and using burning candles to paint with the smoke. I draw inspiration from my own mental health journey as well as trending topics in modern society. By combining both, my style comes alive with bold, snarky, and colorful statement pieces.", "identicon": ""}
