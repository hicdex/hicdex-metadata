{"description": "I am Azita, I do not know English and I use an online translator With my mother's permission, I made this NFT and put it here I am a 12-year-old Afghan girl who wrote my problems in this NFT to the people of the world, which I think is the first letter in the NFT asking for help from people around the world. I am sending a letter and some other NFTs Sorry my poor NFT does not deserve your beautiful look, if I survive I will learn art and share the beauties of my life with you. thanks", "identicon": "ipfs://QmTVyBas37t2HEBow4Q4BoCtsnHWaAVBxCcFukdLD8aGba"}
