{"description": "Em Agosto Chove is a brazilian experimental music project emanated from Cerrado's region of Tocantins, in Palmas. Independently recorded, the track Osiris, composed by Luis and Caio, refers to the passage from life to death and the glimpse there is afterwards. Its immersive atmosphere, which until then seems to be composed only by voice and guitar, reveals itself, through the floating ambiences, deeper and more intimate.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmdL9QbTftFZT5A7dsPXvUZ57FAJCW2gQWBH7FWxJvaxRh"}
