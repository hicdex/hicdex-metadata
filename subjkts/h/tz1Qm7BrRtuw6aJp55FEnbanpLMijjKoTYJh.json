{"description": "'Kawalan' (nothingness) is the term used by the creator to define the word 'Space'. He started exploring the space in 1997. We see a space as if it is empty or nothing's in there. But for sure, that's not the reality of the creator.   Some strips may lookalike but in every space, the creator guaranteed that there will be no totally identical strips/pieces. Like humans living in this space. Every existence has its own color, shape, aura, and beauty!", "identicon": "ipfs://QmWPaWTFqQoU8pRDN3DhixRBsK3VEsHHKHYToZ3553L4ei"}
