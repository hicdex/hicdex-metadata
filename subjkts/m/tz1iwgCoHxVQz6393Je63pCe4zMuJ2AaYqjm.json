{"description": "  I think NFTs are opening brand new opportunities for sculpture. That enables me to animate and play with my physical work. The end result of a piece as a traditional sculptor is static and cannot be changed once done. NFTs allows me to play between static and kinetic, giving motion to stillness.   I also love this idea of making a NFT for each of my piece, it\u2019s like capturing the soul of each physical work and gives another perspective that I find very interesting.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmeMbJA5ywaRe29ookHpbJvbbcVU8cSrk8N2pqsWpjHPjL"}
