{"description": "Olayana is a self-taught digital artist who creates surreal collages. In her artworks she uses AI-generated images as well as elements from photographs. Olayana's artworks are about the fine line between the mundane and what can be hidden from the eyes of the layman. Symbols, images, colors speak about the versatility of our world, about philosophy and reflections on life, as well as about the combination of new trends with tradition.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmXQUT6q1R41zozkHmhzZ38LyTpZDLx9o1iwr5TP9nw8rd"}
