{"description": "In 2011 I took a portrait series of random strangers encountered in online chats \u2013 they were captured from a computer monitor, manipulated, and exhibited in the real world the same year. In 2021, these portraits are back to their initial environment as limited edition NFTs.  First exhibition: Kaunas Photo Festival 2011. Published in The New York Review of Books, Der Greif, FK Magazine, among others.  A project by @romandrits", "identicon": "ipfs://QmSFv8WBojtJ1c59ZUpQdcut28664qppyJZk2ubvC5KGNM"}
