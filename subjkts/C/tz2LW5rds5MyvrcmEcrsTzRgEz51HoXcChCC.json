{"description": "Sam Lubicz is a Los Angeles-born artist / illustrator based in Berlin. His collages investigate not-so-distant dystopian futures with a curious pessimism.  Using obsessive archiving techniques, manipulating imagery sourced from his physical and online  environments, his practice has been compared to that of a human GAN. He is also 1/2 of the music group 333 Boyz.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmVSHshzebDWuBuvsXgb7vqW1VhW44SNMv2hkfak2kiGYr"}
