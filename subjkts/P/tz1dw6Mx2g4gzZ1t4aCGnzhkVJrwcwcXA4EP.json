{"description": "In loving memory of Deborah Gaventa Brown. Here her daughter will showcase the amazing art Deborah created. With a Masters Degree in Fine Arts from Yale and a life long devotion to activism, Deborah is always pushing the boundaries of color and social norms. One of her last wishes was to display her art -- with COVID and the new landscape of NFT's this is perfect way for her friend, family and fans to begin collecting her one of a kind creative spirit.
