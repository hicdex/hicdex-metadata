{"description": "Founded in 2012 by Brooklyn based artist and designer, Phillip David Stearns.  \"Our textiles render the subtle structures of our digital reality into intimate, tactile materials. Our design approach expresses the abstract and invisible language of digital technologies. We believe that the digital world has a vital materiality, one that has the power to touch and move us. That is why we make Glitch Textiles.\"", "identicon": ""}
