{"description": "Welcome to the wonderfully, whimsical, vibrant and slightly mischievous art world of Marc Zuazua.  Marc\u2019s art is influenced by the everyday; however, artistically speaking, cues range from graffiti, cartoons and comics to works by contemporary masters such as Basquiat, Warhol, and Haring. This is pretty evident through his bold use of color and precise outlines.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmWuTxHt98m33dh3W3Aj9dWpFvW8ctfW6yxrCeuC7Kpt3T"}
