{"description": "Gabi is creating art for almost her whole life. She rediscovered digital art in 2020 after having created several pieces in the period 2001 to 2006.  Her work contains lots of nature, from the universe to little bugs and of course humans. She likes to express some of her personal feelings but also creates pieces about global issues like the environment and what happens in our lives.  In Gabi\u2019s colourful work you can find surrealism and photo collage together with drawing and painting.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmdHg5cWR2ELACh18aYC2TMYb5Wosj3EdhkJH3CY2UzHGG"}
