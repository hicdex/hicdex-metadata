{"description": " I am an artist with a disability. After an accident, I broke two cervical vertebrae, which is why I can only move my head and my arms to a very limited extent.  Thanks to modern technology, it is possible for me to create digital art on the PC with a head mouse or with a smartphone which I can operate with my nose and mouth.  I love to express myself artistically.  For me, art means freedom that the wheelchair and my handicap can no longer give me.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmYmbvSQ3fLFgTbbDWQ1M5C6D7eL22DeS57Aq525qiLD6k"}
