{"description": "I am digital and plastic, photo and video, abstract and real artist with a professional photographer certificate. The peculiarity of my work consists in experiments with the abstract potential of the documentary environment. I use the camera matrix as canvas and light as paint. Compared to other trends in contemporary art, abstract expressionism made the greatest impression on me. I follow spontaneity and uncontrolled mental processes like intuition. https://www.pavelproskuryakov.com/", "identicon": "ipfs://QmdrzwkgTBhVw8t41S4UWMEcUQTC1oAUoMmChZecvPdSUC"}
