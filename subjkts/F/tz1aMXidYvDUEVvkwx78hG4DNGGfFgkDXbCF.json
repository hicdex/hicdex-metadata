{"description": "Giving a chaotic world some order since 2011\u2122  I\u2019m a London based photographer and image maker. My work mainly revolves around architecture with an emphasis on symmetry, perspective, motifs, leading lines, serendipity and harmony.  I also have a go at street photography, which I love, but find challenging.  Photomanipulations are a good creative outlet, revolving around geometric patterns and orbs.", "identicon": "ipfs://QmVpHjGHpbfzgKFSyDwANH7q9TBVtEvzogpN9St2PZnCU7"}
